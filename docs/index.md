## About

![Hello](images/home/profile-min.jpeg)

Hello! :cloud: Professionally trained as an architect, I am a ==UIUX / Product designer==. My job revolves around Branding, Interaction Design, User Experience-design, and Visual Design. I build meaningful experiences, connect users and increase system efficiency through design. 

As a designer, I am aware that my decision could have a lasting impact on the user and the environment. I hope to be able to contribute my talent thinking about the planetary well-being. I will take an ethics-first approach to design when considering a product's accessibility and ease of use. It is important for me to know that my work will have a positive impact on people and the environment.
