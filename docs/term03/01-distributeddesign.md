# Distributed Design

## Reflections

In this seminar, we learned about distributed design. It is an interesting introduction to systems thinking + design thinking. I also learned about different groups of people and how to get exposed to exciting student opportunities. I find the notion of system design interesting as it brings the responsibility of the successfulness of a design decision on the efficiency of the system instead of putting it on the shoulders of the stakeholders.

If I were be using a few sentence to summarize what a Mushroom Model does in a design process, I would say that it is great for brain storming, risk checking, product analyzing. I am quite interested to learn more about the parameters to measure the successfulness of the mushroom model and comparing how it is applied to physical and digital product.

### Group Mushroom Model 

On the first day, we choose ChatGPT is our topic.

As an conclusion, we find it quite hard to start a dialougue on this topic as it is quite abstract. Eventually, we were able to exchange opinions and did some research as a group so that we collect useful data to prove our points. The way we move around the mushroom is also quite interesting, we started with making > power > value > knowledge. It is slightly different comparing to the other groups, or example the fertilizer, the bread and the hairpin group.

### Documenting your process on your web including the following reflections (learning skills, dynamics, interactions) for each dayâ€™s activity

### Day 01

#### Learning Skils
*Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future?*

In terms of hard skills and soft skills, I learned that I would need to know more about history of chatGPT and AI chatbot in general so that I can have a comprehensive view on the subject. I think good communication skills is really important and I am still struggling to express vague ideas to something concrete. I will use this opportunity as a playgorund for me to trial and error on my communication skills.

#### Dynamics
*How was the dynamic inside the group?*

The first session, the dynamic is really great as were able to explore and raise interesting conversation regarding chatGPT. We started from making, power, then value and knowledge. Whereas when we are doing the next session, I find myself talking more as I am the one that's staying behind. I would say that we are quite open minded thus the discussion on chatGPT is rather fruitful.

#### Interactions
*Did the role I played influence my opinion?*

Personally, I am a flexible person and I do not have a strong opinion on things. I am able to be unbias and rational about the opinion taht I would be sharing. As I am representing my group to speak up as a final presentation, I find myself being extra concious that I am just somebody that communicating our ideas. So in short, I do not think that my role has influenced my opinion.
