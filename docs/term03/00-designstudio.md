# Design Studio

## Reflections

During class, we had a sharing session on each other's project. For this design studio, we had a discussion on what we wanted to do and how we wantedprogress from what we had last time. As a team, we agree that we will be trying to improve our product and test it out with local school children. 

For my personal work, I came out with a list of things that I will be doing and wrapping up for this term.

1. Innerbot (Done)
2. Perception Board (In progress)
3. Food Connect (Done)
4. App with Jimena (TBD)
5. Forrest Walk (In progress)
6. RoMi UXR

Since everything starting to look clearer in my perspective, I updated my design space. I will no longer be using the old mapping method and will be building on the current format.

As a conclusion, I will keep working on both personal and team project. I have drafed out a whole three month proposal for RoMi UXR and will be talking to Jonathan about it. For our team, we have also drafted a plan and will execute it accordingly.
