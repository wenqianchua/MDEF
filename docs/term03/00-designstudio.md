# Design Studio

## Reflections

### Session 1

During class, we had a sharing session on each other's project. For this design studio, we had a discussion on what we wanted to do and how we wanted to progress from what we had last time. As a team, we agree that we will be trying to improve our product and test it out with local school children. 

For my personal work, I came out with a list of things that I will be doing and wrapping up for this term.

1. Innerbot (Done)
2. Perception Board (In progress)
3. Food Connect (Done)
4. App with Jimena (TBD)
5. Forrest Walk (In progress)
6. RoMi UXR

Since everything starting to look clearer in my perspective, I updated my design space. I will no longer be using the old mapping method and will be building on the current format.

As a conclusion, I will keep working on both personal and team project. I have drafed out a whole three month proposal for RoMi UXR and will be talking to Jonathan about it. For our team, we have also drafted a plan and will execute it accordingly.

### Session 2

*Deliverable: Update your alternative present including a description of the roles you would like to have in it.*

*Task: Update your bio section in your website with an adaptation of your alternative present and your roles in it. Continue developing your interventions.*

My Alternative Present:

Wen started to find opportunities by looking around what is available to her. Instead of focusing on things that she cannot change, she starts to actively engage and look for signals around her cohort. Even though she failed a few times during interviews to get a UX design intern position, she is still able to use it as a practice ground so that she is able to be more confident in future opportunities.

Roles:

As a designer, I am aware that my decision could have a lasting impact on the user and the environment. I hope to be able to contribute my talent thinking about the planetary well-being. I will take an ethics-first approach to design when considering a product's accessibility and ease of use. It is important for me to know that my work will have a positive impact on people and the environment.

Interventions Update:
Ariel, Jime and I started to attend weekly meetings to wrap up everything we have about perception board. We started a file and divided tasks so that we can successfully deliver the project during the festival. We already have a schedule with a work plan to ensure we are efficient and intentional.
