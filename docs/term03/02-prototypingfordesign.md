## Week 01

### Robots

#### Reflection

In today's class, we had a basic understanding of robots. In everyday life, we interact with robots more than we think we know. A normal kuka arm robot has about six axes, and the way to count it is to see how many joints that they have. With a robot, we can do almost everything. I know that for putting together electronics or things like laptops and handphones, robotic arms were used to put them together for precision.

We had a basic understanding of the type of robots and the systems behind it. We saw a lot of robots use wood assembly, cutting, etc. We also see the system behind the robots. In robots, there are many kinds of joints, such as polar, cylindrical, cartesian, jointed arm, and SCARA. The different types of joints will dictate what kind of movement the robot will be doing. There are two types of coordinate: base coordinates and tool coordinates. How a robot moves also will be different depending if it is a joint or linear movement. The difference will be their orientation and velocity. 

The Kuka robot has no sensor so it will be quite dangerous. When you are using a robot, you need to know where the switch is. There are three states: press, and not press, and all the way. There is a way of controlling the robot with rhino - grasshopper. We spent the rest of the class to learn how to use grasshopper to install Rhino.

#### Pictures and Exercises

As a class, there was a demonstration on how to use grasshopper for stimulation. Shortly after, we tried it out in class.

For this class, I am mainly looking at the [lecture resources](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/educational-docs/mdef/classes/robots/) here.


#### Learning Outcomes

My personal learning outcome for this section is to have better understanding on robots and understand how to use Rhino and Grasshopper as a tool to create stimulations.
