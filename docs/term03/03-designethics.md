# Design Ethics

## Reflections

### Week 01

In today's session, I learned that nowadays when designing, it's common that we design for monetization and make people make certain choices. The class started with these 3 important things about technology:

- Technology is part of our existence
- It is not neutral, not does it determine us.
- Design is ethics by other means

We also learned about the IceBerg model. I think this really helps me in understanding better how humans behave. As a UX designer, this seminar relates to me alot. 

- Events: what is happening? > react
- Patterns of behavior: what trends are there? > recognise and anticipate
- Underlying structures: how are the parts systematically related? > challenge and design
- Mental Models: what value, assumption and belief shape the system? > transform

It is interesting to learn how the technological aspect in our daily life is hidden. Sometimes we forget that technology is unavoidable. We forget that the systemic nature of technology is everywhere. When we see a normal picture, for example a picture of a forest or a bathroom, we forget the technological concept of this. The important lesson is that tech has receded from our perception. This is sometimes dangerous as somebody becomes oblivious and indifference, they are not aware of the impact they might create while using technology as a tool. 

What I appreciate about this session is that Ariel emphasizes the importance of the value of each tool created. It also creates an awareness on why or how each culture or action is being carried out. We had an extensive conversation about guns as a tool and the values assigned behind the invention of guns. I personally find it really insightful and we had an interesting and extensive conversation about it in our class. 

In conclusion, this class has opened up new perspectives. Something relates to me personally is the notion of designing with the people. I always believe that in order for a product to be successful and attaining to user goals, we have to design with the party involved, instead of designing for them. It is important to have the values being throughly thought out before creating the any product. It teaches me to be more critical when viewing any designed object. An object is not just an object, it holds the value, the culture, or even the beliefs behind every design decision.
