## Week 01

### Basic Electronics & Coding

#### Reflection

First week into prototyping and design is quite overwhelming. We have a basic overview on how we should choose the board based on what project we will be using. We also learn about different components on the arduino board. The goal is to find out why we need certain electronics and how we integrate it to our projects. 

For this class, we learn about how to select the right arduino for a project. How do we select the board? What are the aspects we need to think of? Is it the Power? Network? Memory? How to find it and what is the best for you? When selecting the board, it is important to consider the capacity. One quick way is to double check the microcontroller and search for the datasheet on the web to better understand it. When considering what board we should use, it is also important to think about how much power and memory that your [microcontroller](https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/material/extras/week04/whatisamicrocontroller/#now-actually-what-is-a-microcontroller) has.

We also learned the difference between a microcontroller and a computer. Arduino is a lot of things but not a microcontroller, but arduino has microcontroller boards. Arduino is a brand of the board, and it is very amazing because it is an advancement for prototyping ideas. With Arduino, we are able to make prototyping ideas quick and easy. 

The Arduino hardware is completely open source, other manufacturers can easily copy their hardware. The difference here is Arduino invests a lot in their software. They offer us a very simple interface so that it makes communicating to the microcontroller easier. They manage to create a big community of people that uses the same spirit of sharing what they learn on the arduino.

And some general rule of thumb when dealing with coding failure and debugging is to double check your wiring and codes. Try to divide the problem as small as we can to make solving the problem easier.

For this class, I am mainly looking at the [lecture resources](https://hackmd.io/VBeyTyQoTLev4gjLzZkqQw?view#Electronics-amp-coding) shared on the arduino board.


#### Learning Outcomes

My personal learning outcome for this section is to have a more broader view in electronics and how potentially I would be able to use this knowledge to solve everyday problems. Also, to be able to run a simple code so that the buzzer will play. Personally, I am thankful that there is more flexibility for students to decide the depth of the technical if we want to do more research.

### 2D Design Tools (Parametric Design)

#### Reflection

Today, the class started with a basic group session to learn about the existing software knowledge in modeling. We contributed to this miro board:

We have a better understanding of CAM: Computer aided design. We also learned the difference between Vector and Raster files. Vectors are the geometric (mathematical) description of an image. Whereas Raster are mostly made out of pixels, there are essentially small squares and also a memory eater. Most photographs are raster files. The process of changing Raster to pixel is called interpolation. I find this interesting because when I was in architecture school, how I understood vector files is that file that has the x and y axis information. This is essential as when you are using another machine such as a laser cutter, the machine needs the coordinates to precisely cut where we want it to be. We also learned that computers are made out of CPU and GPU, and each of them process different file types.

>We also learned about mesh and nurbs. A mesh model is a collection of vertical, edges and faces. 

We learn that to form a design, it start with points > then connecting it with lines > joining the surfaces > forming polygons to create meshes and you will have your final model. 

This process reminds me a lot of [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/). Atomic design is a methodology composed of stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. While it is not exactly the same thing, but I find understanding the parametric in this sense will make your design more accessible and give you full control to it.

I also find it ironic that even though phones get better in showing the amount of pixels per inch, the human eye can only take in 200+ pixels. Yet, more pixels will need more memory from the phone. It makes me feel bad about this aspect of technology as they are using the lack of knowledge of the society in tech as an advantage to market their product. 

Overall, I find it very refreshing and interesting to learn about parametrics again in this context. I will be trying to create some models using rhino and grasshopper to test out some of my ideas.

I also did some research and reading on Zaha Hadid's Parametric Architecture.

#### Learning Outcomes

For this section I hope to understand better different file formats so that I can use it on the right machine effectively. Also, I hope to have a better grasp on Parametric Design and understand how it works. Even though I had used rhino and grasshopper and ladybug before, I am not really familiar in the concept of how parametric works. I aim to explore at least one of the tools for algorithmic design.
