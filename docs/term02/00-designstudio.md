# Design Studio

## Reflecting and Reframing

*Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development allowing
your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called “failures” as opportunities for
redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project
Accordingly.*

*Deliverables:*

*An updated version of your design space. A 500 word text with a
summary of your journey so far, adding the repositioning of yourself and your project.
Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1st
intervention of the second trimester.*

>Innerbot

![Innerbot](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/Innerbot%20First%20Intervention.jpg)

Innerbot is a GPT3 powered mobile application that uses real data to help users connect with simulated versions of themselves or others. 

>Key Learnings

- Potential to use it as a conversation rehearsal tool for example to stimulate hard conversation.
- Some people find it taxing to collect information so if this would be a digital product eventually, we have to find a way to remove pain points.
- Concern of ethics, fear of being unable to tell the differences. Need to manage expectations.
- Potential to adapt functions such as identify patterns in user’s behavior and communication style. 
- For violence prevention would be interesting to see if the tool will be able to show the participants when there are red flags or when someone can be violent. Need to design full experience for the product to be responsible.
- The process of building the AI bot can be part of the healing process.
- AI was able to answer in another language.
- However, if it is not mentioned, AI will default back to answer in English.
- Might need to prepare a list of questions as sometimes some user is unsure what to ask.
- When asking general questions such as future plans, etc, we get general answers. When asking more intricate and detailed question, we get a response that will better depict who the user are as a person
- Some users feel uncomfortable with the notion of machines one day having the ability to write so humanly and eventually begets the question of what it means to be human? Especially if the "Geist" is so easily captured by a non-living object. 

>Building the Futures.

![Futures](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/First%20iteration%20-%20Park%20intervention%20with%20children%203-6%20years%20old.jpeg)

This is an intervention where we co-creating and imagine futures with and for children in public spaces and schools in Barcelona.

>Stories that was created from the activity:

- “A kid and a car” - 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval.
- “The grass and the hat, and the sloth will go out of the hat.” 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval.
- “The baby brushes her teeth, goes to the car and sleeps”. -  3 years old, female in a park near Raval.
- “A boy and her little sister, he teases her and the bees tease them” - 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval.
- “The worm teases the baby.” - A 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval.
- “Cars are bad for the future because of the gas, I prefer bikes, walking. The future with gas and cars is bad.” - Group of 7-10 year old girls and boys in a park near Raval. They said the future with pollution looks bad. They seem like migrants, and are environmentally conscious. Had no adult supervision.
- “In the future technology and contamination are everywhere.” “Barcelona has no space for animals, animals should be free not in zoos”. “Nature should have more space in the city”. “Barcelona is not very accessible for handicapped people”. - 13-14 year olds girls and boys outside of school in Sant Antoni.

>Key Learnings:

- Hard to approach when the childrens are playing, and it is important to talk to parents first. There is no need for consent forms.
- Sometimes the kids can be too young , parents act as translators and facilitators.
- Places of transit are not a good place to engage with children.
- Very literal interpretations.
- Teachers bringing groups for field trips on site will not be a good option as they were busy working managing large groups time constraints with no consent directly from parents.
- Potential to drive workshops that can be designed for play.
- Potential to incorporate AI.
- Consider aesthetics and graphics when designing for different age groups.
- Kids from age 11-13 had better critical thinking skills and were able to make connections between images.
- We can potentially try using words instead of images.
- Potential to use pictures that the kids do not pay attention to as part of the data collected

### General Reflections

![Reflection](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/08_DesignDialouguePrep.JPG)

Through my projects, I learned how to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I had the opportunity to collaborate with experts from their fields and I was able to learn from how they work. Secondly, I learned how to apply AI and technology on subjects related to healing and mental health. In the beginning, I thought that it is quite hard to relate mental health with current technologies, as research suggests that the use of technology, increased screen time especially social media links to negative effects to mental health. Right now, I think technology could be used as  a tool in healing. Third, I also noticed that it was not easy to work with a subject that can be quite heavy and personal to some people. Therefore, I am starting to observe ways that can be more subtle and gentle.

For co-creating futures with the kids project, we learned a lot through our intervention. It is important to just go out and try out our ideas even though the activity might seem imperfect. As we planned our intervention to have an activity with the kids in school, it is good that through executing it earlier with the park intervention, we failed early, and were able to try things out. We were able to learn our point of failure and the parents were happy to help us. This will help us to be mindful and design a better activity when engaging with school children.

### Updated Design Space

My Design Space might look a little different than the conventional ones, but this is what make sense to me and I was able to work in this format better compared to the initial design space. Thus, I will keep building on my design space with this format. For full prototype of my design space, please check [here](https://wenqianchua.github.io/MDEF/reflections/)
