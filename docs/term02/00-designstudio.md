# Design Studio

## Reflecting and Reframing

*Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development allowing
your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called “failures” as opportunities for
redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project
Accordingly.*

*Deliverables:*

*An updated version of your design space. A 500 word text with a
summary of your journey so far, adding the repositioning of yourself and your project.
Make explicit new project goals and next steps including a proposal for the 1st
intervention of the second trimester.*

### Reflections

>Innerbot

![Innerbot](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/Innerbot%20First%20Intervention.jpg)

Innerbot is a GPT3 powered mobile application that uses real data to help users connect with simulated versions of themselves or others. 

>Key Learnings

- Potential to use it as a conversation rehearsal tool for example to stimulate hard conversation.
- Some people find it taxing to collect information so if this would be a digital product eventually, we have to find a way to remove pain points.
- Concern of ethics, fear of being unable to tell the differences. Need to manage expectations.
- Potential to adapt functions such as identify patterns in user’s behavior and communication style. 
- For violence prevention would be interesting to see if the tool will be able to show the participants when there are red flags or when someone can be violent. Need to design full experience for the product to be responsible.
- The process of building the AI bot can be part of the healing process.
- AI was able to answer in another language.
- However, if it is not mentioned, AI will default back to answer in English.
- Might need to prepare a list of questions as sometimes some user is unsure what to ask.
- When asking general questions such as future plans, etc, we get general answers. When asking more intricate and detailed question, we get a response that will better depict who the user are as a person
- Some users feel uncomfortable with the notion of machines one day having the ability to write so humanly and eventually begets the question of what it means to be human? Especially if the "Geist" is so easily captured by a non-living object. 

>Building the Futures

![Futures](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/First%20iteration%20-%20Park%20intervention%20with%20children%203-6%20years%20old.jpeg)

This is an intervention where we co-creating and imagine futures with and for children in public spaces and schools in Barcelona.

>Stories that was created from the activity:

- “A kid and a car” - 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval.
- “The grass and the hat, and the sloth will go out of the hat.” 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval.
- “The baby brushes her teeth, goes to the car and sleeps”. -  3 years old, female in a park near Raval.
- “A boy and her little sister, he teases her and the bees tease them” - 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval.
- “The worm teases the baby.” - A 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval.
- “Cars are bad for the future because of the gas, I prefer bikes, walking. The future with gas and cars is bad.” - Group of 7-10 year old girls and boys in a park near Raval. They said the future with pollution looks bad. They seem like migrants, and are environmentally conscious. Had no adult supervision.
- “In the future technology and contamination are everywhere.” “Barcelona has no space for animals, animals should be free not in zoos”. “Nature should have more space in the city”. “Barcelona is not very accessible for handicapped people”. - 13-14 year olds girls and boys outside of school in Sant Antoni.

>Key Learnings:

- Hard to approach when the childrens are playing, and it is important to talk to parents first. There is no need for consent forms.
- Sometimes the kids can be too young , parents act as translators and facilitators.
- Places of transit are not a good place to engage with children.
- Very literal interpretations.
- Teachers bringing groups for field trips on site will not be a good option as they were busy working managing large groups time constraints with no consent directly from parents.
- Potential to drive workshops that can be designed for play.
- Potential to incorporate AI.
- Consider aesthetics and graphics when designing for different age groups.
- Kids from age 11-13 had better critical thinking skills and were able to make connections between images.
- We can potentially try using words instead of images.
- Potential to use pictures that the kids do not pay attention to as part of the data collected

### General Reflections

![Reflection](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/08_DesignDialouguePrep.JPG)

Through my projects, I learned how to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I had the opportunity to collaborate with experts from their fields and I was able to learn from how they work. Secondly, I learned how to apply AI and technology on subjects related to healing and mental health. In the beginning, I thought that it is quite hard to relate mental health with current technologies, as research suggests that the use of technology, increased screen time especially social media links to negative effects to mental health. Right now, I think technology could be used as  a tool in healing. Third, I also noticed that it was not easy to work with a subject that can be quite heavy and personal to some people. Therefore, I am starting to observe ways that can be more subtle and gentle.

![Reflection](../images/term02/01_Design%20Studio/Park%20intervention.jpeg)

For co-creating futures with the kids project, we learned a lot through our intervention. It is important to just go out and try out our ideas even though the activity might seem imperfect. As we planned our intervention to have an activity with the kids in school, it is good that through executing it earlier with the park intervention, we failed early, and were able to try things out. We were able to learn our point of failure and the parents were happy to help us. This will help us to be mindful and design a better activity when engaging with school children.

### Next Steps

Personally during my exploration last term, I was able to dive deep into the topic and encountered a lot of confrontation. I learned how to set boundaries to separate design interventions with my personal life. Even though the process is uncomfortable, my internal healing process is apparent.

I was very honest to myself and after building the AI chatbot, I was inspired to seek closure with people who have caused me pain in real life. It was what I really needed. As a result of the confrontation and embracing it, I was able to release the burden on my shoulder that has been with me for many years. It is really unbelievable to see the quality of my emotional well-being have improved. I was able to see joy everyday and woke up feeling content, peaceful and safe. Even when there are negative emotions and events, they come and go like a cloud.

I also noticed that I have developed a skill set to accept myself. I was able to appreciate what makes me different from others, such as my way of living, the love to spend time being alone, and not being sociable enough as an essential part that makes some of my talents possible. I will not be able to paint, to play the piano and violin, and to write stories without these traits. This is an important realization as I have always been trying to force myself to ‘fit in’ and when I failed to do so, I was trapped in an endless whirlpool of self-blaming. Being honest with myself, and being able to say no to what is not for you without guilt is a big advancement for me. Since we’re living in a world that explodes with all sorts of information and opportunity, I think it is crucial to know what you really want to be able to dedicate your full presence and attention to. 
Time and attention is a scarce resource, so I want to make sure that for every decision I make it is a conscious and mindful act so that I am able to face whatever challenges and be accountable for the decisions’ output.

Critically observing myself, I noticed that my strong drive towards mental health is slowly fading as a result of my healing. I guess in the past I had a strong desire to be heard and heal. Even though I am still really concerned about topics related to mental health, what drives me more now are topics related to the brain, subconscious and the cognitive process. While I am still interested in designing a product that can ease and improve the therapy process, now I will start to wrap up the Inner Bot project and focus more on the group project-co-creating futures with children.

I will pay attention to what this change might lead me to. In the meantime, I will be focusing on my new interests and see how it could potentially combine with my on going projects. I will be visiting the Bologna Children’s Book Fair as an illustrator, and right now I am preparing a series of books that teaches children how to manage their emotions. Therefore, I think the series of intervention, my interest in cognitive science, subconscious and learning would help me grow professionally and personally to create a meaningful artifact.

### Updated Design Space

My Design Space might look a little different than the conventional ones, but this is what make sense to me and I was able to work in this format better compared to the initial design space. Thus, I will keep building on my design space with this format. For full prototype of my design space, please check [here](https://wenqianchua.github.io/MDEF/reflections/)

## Design Intervention in Context

*Deliverables*

*Document the 1PP design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. Describe the alternative present scenario that this intervention is offering. Then, update your design with the relations you have built.*

### Reflections

As our first official intervention after our experimentation in the park, we carried out our first workshop in Collegi Sant Andreu (Infantil - Primària) with 7 years old school children.

This would be a 60 minutes workshop, carried out with 25 students.

We will be facilitating the workshop where the children imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected.

We will be using magazine pictures and worksheets showing pictures of places, such as parks, schools, zoos, and etc. We are using 'local' images so that the children can familiarize themselves with it.

### General Observations


- Children at the age of 7 are very obedient when everybody is doing the same thing. For example, when the children are getting too noisy, we raise one of our hands as a signal for everyone to pay attention. As a result, every child followed the action and they were able to keep quiet and pay attention.
- Furthermore, when dealing with children, they have a very short attention span. It is hard to keep them engaged and ask them to listen while the other group is presenting.
- Children tend to speak freely among their peers and have an activated discussion. 
- There is a difference between children age 7 and age 13/14 when interacting with an adult. Teenagers interact with an adult like a 'friend' whereas little kids will feel a little shy.
- When guiding the activity, as facilitator, we try not to give concrete examples so that they have more room to be creative and create their own collage.
- In the process of explaining, we tend to squat down so that we are at the same eye level with the children.
- Children prefer hands-on activity rather than presentation to keep engaged. I notice that when we are showing slides, some of the children start to get distracted, whereas when we are doing the physical activity, most of them are engaged in an active discussion.


### Alternative Presents


>As a team, our intention is to collect the ideas that they generated and work on it and continue to be inspired by the collage that they made. Questions that we asked ourselves include:

- Is there a difference between their interaction among their peers vs adults (facilitators and teachers) during this project?
- As a facilitator, how can we communicate with the children more efficiently using body language, expression and choice of words?
- As a facilitator, how can we collect children's ideas of the future without influencing their creative process?
- How can we move forward from what we have learned?
- What do we do with the data collected?

We foresee a few potentials, including creating a standard workshop so that any school can use our framework, create some workshop materials and make a demo video so that it is more accessible to other schools, or perhaps collaborating with more schools to refine our methodology.

>We also received some feedback for improvement.

- Some pictures might not be appropriate for the children.
- While children are sharing, it is difficult for all of the other kids to see the collage.
- Children ask if we would be going back for another intervention.

### Next Steps

We would be preparing for another intervention shortly for two other classes on the same day. To be well equipped for the next intervention, we will be refining our project by preparing more materials (pictures and worksheet), find a way to forecast the children’s collage and so that everybody can see it during the sharing session, and also keep our presentation time short and quick. We did well in time keeping so we would try to keep that up. We will see what happens during our next intervention and decide how to move forward from that.
