### Reflection

During the Future Talk series with Audrey Desjardins, my key takeaway Us is to use design as a mode of enquiry, and also using design to articulate questions rather than a final product. This is very relevant with my learning experience in the MDEF program. As an experienced designer, I spent the first five years in my career and academia using design to create a desired product. Ever since I started my interventions, I noticed that I am using design as a tool to enlighten doubts that I have. Now, I trust the design process and see what the output would be.

I have the opportunity to share some of my doubts with Dr. Desjardins. One of my main concerns is what would be the boundaries or guidelines when we are doing research on mental health. While currently there is no clear board that states the rules and regulations for executing research as such, from what I learnt, it is important to understand and be very mindful of which community we are working together with.

Oscar also raised the issue of when do we actually set the boundaries and choose what to show and what not to show as a professional. I have actually been reflecting on this frequently, and this is part of the reason why I am slowly taking a few steps back from what I have been sharing, not because of the fear of confrontation, but because of the clarity of my state of mind.

I noticed that when I first joined this masters program, I was in a chaotic situation. I am not mentally unstable, but I felt very lost and had no clear sense of purpose. People might perceive me differently or even be intimidated by my disclosure of some part of my drive that could be too personal for an acquaintance to access. However, I am grateful for my honesty and openness that brings me to make decisions that lead me to clarity.

There is a saying where in order to rebuild, you have to destroy first. Destruction is all part of creation. I think by ‘destroying’ my existing beliefs, being open to vulnerability and exposing my wound to acquaintances, I could see myself in a better light. I can tell what is for me and what is not for me with clarity. Figuring out what you really want is not easy, but knowing what you don’t want would certainly help paint the picture better.

With that note, I will make sure that my heart is aligned with my head, trusting the design process and be very mindful of what I will be involved with in my personal life from the upcoming process.
