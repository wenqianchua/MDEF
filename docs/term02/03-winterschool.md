# Winter School Indegeneity and Adaptation

## Reflections

During the first week of Winter School from the 16th to 20th, I learned about the auto-ehthnographic in Design, Creative placemaking design and also Sensory Mapping. On the first day, Albert shared this [lecture slide](../files/pdf/Self%20Care/Fact%20Sheets/objective.pdf). It made me reflect about my position as a designer in relation to my surroundings.

During the lecture with Zsofia, we explored methods to design with the idea of place as a sensory experience in this [lecture slide](../files/pdf/Winter%20School/Winter%20School_MethodologicalApproach.pdf). One of the activity that we did was to execute a sensory walk around the city. Together as a cohort, we contributed to a collective Miro Board.
