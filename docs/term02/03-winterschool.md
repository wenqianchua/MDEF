# Winter School Indegeneity and Adaptation

## Reflections

During the first week of Winter School from the 16th to 20th, I learned about the auto-ehthnographic in Design, Creative placemaking design and also Sensory Mapping. On the first day, Albert shared this [lecture slide](../files/pdf/Winter%20School/Winter%20School_MethodologicalApproach.pdf). It made me reflect about my position as a designer in relation to my surroundings.

### Sensory Methods
During the lecture with Zsofia, we explored methods to design with the idea of place as a sensory experience in this [lecture slide](../files/pdf/Winter%20School/Sensory%20Methods_GSA_Winterschool_2023_small.pdf). One of the activity that we did was to execute a sensory walk around the city. Together as a cohort, we contributed to a collective Miro Board.

I have documented my personal experience, focusing on the sense of smell and sound during this project.

During the presentation, we have discussed the notion of sound can be so powerful as it brings back us in time. It allows us to access our memories and feelings just from some chemical substances.

One feedback that I got is smell, like taste, is a very personal and intimate sensory experience - they both rely upon other means of communication to be shared. They demand dialogue and interaction to move from individual to share, even though they are experienced by all, sometimes simultaneously. Like the wind, perhaps they are made visible by their “effects”? Unlike sense sound and vision that can be depicted easilty with our electronic device,the experience of smell and taste could not be transfered to the user electronically.

Another interesting conversation that raised during our discussion is to think of “place” as a transient space, as an event that comes and goes, that is defined more by time than space. Does this make our sensory interaction and engagement more important, and our recording of something that is ephemeral? Place as a vanishing phenomenon?

So, a place exists as part of our experience - but the experience of space is always changing and it is not going to be permanent.

### Digital Postcard

We had multiple discussion on indegeneity. Also, we argue that indegeneity can be from a person but not the place. For example, if somebody is bringing the culture from where they were from to a foreign land, they could still bring a sense of indegeneity of their own culture.

In the assignment of creating a digital postcard, as a group, we discussed about the iconic Sagrada Familia. Ironically, it is built for the people of Barcelona, but most locals think that the church does not belong to them anymore as it was bombarded by tourists.

We created a platform for ourselves to share thoughts and ideas.
