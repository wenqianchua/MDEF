# Making Sense and Meaning

## Reflection

>In the first week, we talked about using a multiscalar approach to look at the world. 

It is interesting as most of the design principles started from a european centric culture. From a UX standpoint, I couldn't agree more with this idea. Having the experience to work for both 'western' and 'eastern' projects, the notion of "less is more" can hardly be applied on UX project in China. 

>In China, you will notice that most of the app is compact and full of information. 

It is almost like Chinese application follows "more is more" concept. For this, I think it is important to understand it from the structure of the chinese character and english alphabets. Since chinese character are compact and able to communicate more meaning using a significantly less space, it allows the interface to accomodate more things. Moreover in chinese culture, we celebrate vastness and inclusion of everything, thus when an interface design is so called "crowded" from the western standpoint, it works perfectly for the users of chinese region since they are used to the concept.

I think it is important to look at the design case studies based on the context while being concious of the whatever design principles that we are practicing. In the end of the day, it is crucial to consider who are the users, the real people who are using the product rather then following the so called "universal design principle" which is mostly created from the western society.

>During the second week, we had the opportunity to receive a guest lecturer from Peru, Beno Juarez. 

One sentence that stayed in my mind is how the value of the object is not in the object itself, but in the user's capacity. Using a pencil as an example, it depends on the user's imagination and perconceived notion to decide the function of itself. This is a very philosophical statement, but at the same time it unleashes one's potential. You are more capable than you think you are, most of the time, humans are limited by their own perception.

The test of your favourite and least favourite animal is also an interesting exercise, I think it is like a psychological test in some way. Although I am not sure how mine would fit in the context, since my favourite animal is an owl and the reason I like it is because it is very wise, have good vision and able to turn its head 270 degree. 

>Beno also shared that technology is not the bad thing when introducing it to indegenous culture, but how we are using it. I could not agree more. 

I have been exposed to many talks that celebrate the notion of either-or, nature or tech. It is the time to recognize that we are entering an era to co-exist with both nature and tech. I think it is important for the indegenious culture to atleast have some access of technology, and this would be a starting point, or an alternative tool for them to bring their knowledge to us. How can we bring nature back into the cities? What can we learn from the indegenious cultures, learning how to reconnect with nature?

In the course's reading: A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things, there is an excerpt on Early Colonialism and Nature: To live is to alter one's environment...While humans are an environmental-making-species, our organizations are fragile...civilizations have emerged and expanded with more than a little help from the rest of the nature, and when that help is withdrawn, they can crumble.

This emphasize that we are very much depending on nature but we forgot how powerless we were, colonizers has drastically changed the way human could realte with nature by attaching values such as resources, gold, spices on a particular naturae land that they aim to conquer. Like the preface of the Steps to an Ecology of Mind mentioned: "The man who believes that the resources of the world are infinite, for example, or that if somethign is good for you then the more of it the better, will not be able to see his errors, because he will not look for the evidence for them."

>With the capitalism society that is newly born in the last century, we forget that without respecting and restoring the connection with nature, it is the matter of time we will be facing the consequences. 

Nature has been shaped into something 'cheap', like an object. Lands are owned by land owners, and they further transform how others could relate to nature. It might be a very painful but uncomfortable experience, yet we have to be concious that these issues exsits: the exploitation of indegenious land and culture, the history, the disconnection of our people with nature before we can decide how to alleviate the harm that has been done.
