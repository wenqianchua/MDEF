# Making Sense and Meaning

## Reflection

In the first week, we talked about using a multiscalar approach to look at the world. It is interesting as most of the design principles started from a european centric culture. From a UX standpoint, I couldn't agree more with this idea. Having the experience to work for both 'western' and 'eastern' projects, the notion of "less is more" can hardly be applied on UX project in China. 

In China, you will notice that most of the app is compact and full of information. It is almost like Chinese application follows "more is more" concept. For this, I think it is important to understand it from the structure of the chinese character and english alphabets. Since chinese character are compact and able to communicate more meaning using a significantly less space, it allows the interface to accomodate more things. Moreover in chinese culture, we celebrate vastness and inclusion of everything, thus when an interface design is so called "crowded" from the western standpoint, it works perfectly for the users of chinese region since they are used to the concept.

I think it is very interesting to look at the design case studies being concious of the notion. In the end of the day, it is crucial to consider who are the users, the real people who are using the product rather then following the so called "universal design principle" which is mostly created from the western society.
