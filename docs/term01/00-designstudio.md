# Design Studio

## Research and Prototyping

*Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on “your poster, your vision, and desired professional identity”. Reflect on the 4 different roles of prototyping by answering the following two questions. Which ones have you used and for what purposes? Which ones you haven’t used and how do you think could be interesting for you? Afterward, select the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them, and other design activities that you want to use.*

My RtD toolbox will be a combination of Accumulative, Expansive, and Probing.

Based on my experience, when the research direction is clear and specific, I would use Accumulative. When I have a concept with a few ways to illustrate an idea, then Expansive would be my approach. Probing is a technique that I use when I am working with ambiguity.

As a UIUX designer, the most common role of prototyping that I have been using is a prototype as an Experimental Component. I prepared low-fid and high-fid prototypes to carry out usability testing or showcase to see if it works. Most of the time multiple prototypes were prepared for a scenario to see which provides a better experience. One of the examples that I did during my work:
[UX Case Study](https://www.behance.net/gallery/141887389/UX-Case-Study-Design-Enhancement)
 
I had experience using prototypes as a Means of Inquiry through my previous project:
[Reimagining My Sejahtera](https://www.behance.net/gallery/123693987/Reimagining-My-Sejahtera)
This is a way for collecting data and seeing how humans interact with the design. My Sejahtera is a covid-19 tracking and appointment management app in Malaysia, my partner and I redesign the app based on a series of research and interviews. We launched the designs and sent the prototype to people around us. Then, we use the heatmap to visualize the user flow throughout the process. We learned about users’ pain points and struggles through interviewing them. In the end, the final product produced is a series of interventions based on the data we collected.
 
My experience of prototyping as a Research Archetype is when I had to make ‘space’ in architecture school through a kit of parts: wood, strings, and tapes. We end up using the materials to visualize the scale for different spatial situations and floor plans. It is helpful as we were able to bring our project to 1:1 scale, physically experience and experiment with it before putting our ideas into rendering software. Our temporal installation is also tangible, this means that we can easily change the experience with just a few touches. Besides that, I also had experience choosing materials and finishing from catalogs while I was doing architecture-related projects.
 
I have not experienced using prototyping as a Vehicle of Enquiry. This can be an opportunity for me to apply this method in my upcoming projects. Using prototyping as a tool to document and analyze the process sounds interesting to me. I have never tried this method, so I might apply this on my future design product. It would be interesting to see how I can craft a digital or physical product through this method of prototyping, as normally I am inclined to use prototyping as a test of hypothesis or an open ended exploration due to my job nature. I also think this way of prototyping is very liberal, as the results will not be limited by a preconceived notion or a specific group of people.
 
Since I have quite some experiences with the different roles of prototyping, I would like to  start with using prototyping as a Vehicle of Enquiry, the one that I experienced the least so that I can equip myself with this skill set. It seems to me that Probing might be a good pairing with this role of prototyping. With this in mind, I will set this pair as a general direction when executing my upcoming design project. At the same time, I will keep an open mind to include other RtD tools and roles of prototyping whenever it is necessary should the scenario change.

## My Work Space

*Create a “new workspace” where your present and desired RtD toolbox can be used. You need to map what you have available for your project (materials, infrastructure, things, and people) either here or in other places.*

For this part of the assignment, I will be focusing on networking, resources and people that I have as I think they are the most crucial part to complete my future design intervention.

## Communication Strategies

*Instructions: Choose 1 or more roles and formats from the list that was collectively created in class and put them into practice. Write a post with a reflection on the communication strategy that you are devising for the next stages of your project.*

The communication strategies that I have chosen are:

- Compiling the experiences you have already had to aid you when pitching or explaining your process to others can help you move forward.

- Show your work or a specific topic from your own point of view. 

- Simple language for accessibility.

- Being transparent about your intentions, offering a space where people you are trying to reach and connect can understand better your background, your values, your commitment, your motives, and your positionality – creating a foundation for trust.

- Creating demos, demonstrators, or experiential prototypes. 

- Experiment with new formats, such as WhatsApp, videotaping etc

- Photographing

- Video journaling

- Zoom gatherings

>With that in mind, I created a series of pitch presentations to communicate my ideas. 

I have compiled things that I learned in a simple and legible format using infographics. This will help readers to get a sense of the direction of the project.

I am also inspired to create a tutorial video for my crisis/hope box. This is something that I have never tried before. It will be a great starting point as there is a potential of reaching a wider audience not limited by location and time differences. Besides, I would also like to experiment with using hashtags to create a supportive community.
I plan to execute my ideas in 4 different stages, and I am interested to use in-person meetings, zoom gatherings, WhatsApp and google meet to carry out the workshop.
