Reflect on the 4 different roles of prototyping by answering the following two questions. Which ones have you used and for what purposes? Which ones you haven\u2019t used and how do you think could be interesting for you? Afterward, select the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them, and other design activities that you want to use. My RtD toolbox will be a combination of Accumulative, Expansive, and Probing. Based on my experience, when the research direction is clear and specific, I would use Accumulative. When I have a concept with a few ways to illustrate an idea, then Expansive would be my approach. Probing is a technique that I use when I am working with ambiguity. As a UIUX designer, the most common role of prototyping that I have been using is a prototype as an Experimental Component. I prepared low-fid and high-fid prototypes to carry out usability testing or showcase to see if it works. Most of the time multiple prototypes were prepared for a scenario to see which provides a better experience. One of the examples that I did during my work: UX Case Study I had experience using prototypes as a Means of Inquiry through my previous project: Reimagining My Sejahtera This is a way for collecting data and seeing how humans interact with the design. My Sejahtera is a covid-19 tracking and appointment management app in Malaysia, my partner and I redesign the app based on a series of research and interviews. We launched the designs and sent the prototype to people around us. Then, we use the heatmap to visualize the user flow throughout the process. We learned about users\u2019 pain points and struggles through interviewing them. In the end, the final product produced is a series of interventions based on the data we collected. My experience of prototyping as a Research Archetype is when I had to make \u2018space\u2019 in architecture school through a kit of parts: wood, strings, and tapes. We end up using the materials to visualize the scale for different spatial situations and floor plans. It is helpful as we were able to bring our project to 1:1 scale, physically experience and experiment with it before putting our ideas into rendering software. Our temporal installation is also tangible, this means that we can easily change the experience with just a few touches. Besides that, I also had experience choosing materials and finishing from catalogs while I was doing architecture-related projects. I have not experienced using prototyping as a Vehicle of Enquiry. This can be an opportunity for me to apply this method in my upcoming projects. Using prototyping as a tool to document and analyze the process sounds interesting to me. I have never tried this method, so I might apply this on my future design product. It would be interesting to see how I can craft a digital or physical product through this method of prototyping, as normally I am inclined to use prototyping as a test of hypothesis or an open ended exploration due to my job nature. I also think this way of prototyping is very liberal, as the results will not be limited by a preconceived notion or a specific group of people. Since I have quite some experiences with the different roles of prototyping, I would like to start with using prototyping as a Vehicle of Enquiry, the one that I experienced the least so that I can equip myself with this skill set. It seems to me that Probing might be a good pairing with this role of prototyping. With this in mind, I will set this pair as a general direction when executing my upcoming design project. At the same time, I will keep an open mind to include other RtD tools and roles of prototyping whenever it is necessary should the scenario change. My Work Space \u00b6 Create a \u201cnew workspace\u201d where your present and desired RtD toolbox can be used. You need to map what you have available for your project (materials, infrastructure, things, and people) either here or in other places. For this part of the assignment, I will be focusing on networking, resources and people that I have as I think they are the most crucial part to complete my future design intervention. Communication Strategies \u00b6 Choose 1 or more roles and formats from the list that was collectively created in class and put them into practice. Write a post with a reflection on the communication strategy that you are devising for the next stages of your project. The communication strategies that I have chosen are: Compiling the experiences you have already had to aid you when pitching or explaining your process to others can help you move forward. Show your work or a specific topic from your own point of view. Simple language for accessibility. Being transparent about your intentions, offering a space where people you are trying to reach and connect can understand better your background, your values, your commitment, your motives, and your positionality \u2013 creating a foundation for trust. Creating demos, demonstrators, or experiential prototypes. Experiment with new formats, such as WhatsApp, videotaping etc Photographing Video journaling Zoom gatherings With that in mind, I created a series of pitch presentations to communicate my ideas. I have compiled things that I learned in a simple and legible format using infographics. This will help readers to get a sense of the direction of the project. I am also inspired to create a tutorial video for my crisis/hope box. This is something that I have never tried before. It will be a great starting point as there is a potential of reaching a wider audience not limited by location and time differences. Besides, I would also like to experiment with using hashtags to create a supportive community. I plan to execute my ideas in 4 different stages, and I am interested to use in-person meetings, zoom gatherings, WhatsApp and google meet to carry out the workshop. Intervention \u00b6 For my intervention, I would like to learn about The willingness for people to embrace the opportunity to heal. Is this model useful to encourage people to learn more about their family? Will the participant learn something new about themselves through activity? Will participants are open to participating in something like this in future? From 24 th - 27 th of November, I was able to gather responses from 16 people through a guided activity and questionnaire using this google form . Loading\u2026 I have used the Double Diamond Design Model as a framework, first exploring all the possibilities, then deciding which part I would like to focus on based on the data and feedback collected for any prospective design intervention. This intervention is divided into 4 parts. First, I created a short questionnaire as preparation and data gathering. I have included this image to see if there is a relationship between people acting on the different hemispheres of the brain and the willingness to heal. (Thanks to Antonio for sharing this!) Then, I prepared a short activity for the participants to trace their family tree and family history. After that, they will be describing their parents, loved ones and close friends. Last but not least, I have included some feedback questions to see how they feel after the whole activity. The whole process takes approximately 20-30 minutes. I have been doing this through three ways Zoom/ Google meet Whatsapp In person Tools Google Forms, Device Pen and Paper Methodology This methodology has been excerpt partly from It didn\u2019t start with you by Mark Wolynn I have prepared the survey in 3 languages- English, Korean and Spanish to accommodate my targeted participants. Demographics People that have participated in this activity is from Malaysia, Indonesia, Spain, Korea, United States and Canada. I have reached out to my family, friends, colleagues, and strangers that I have been talking to in a language learning app. Their occupations are not limited to students, working professionals, athletes, and instructors. While carrying out this activity in person, as some part of the activity is quite personal, I tried to look away when the participant is drawing their family tree and writing a description of their parents. Key findings Half of my participants do not suffer with mental health issues , and half of them think they might be suffering or are having mental health issues. Most of them are quite close to their family members , their results ranging from the scale of 7-9. When they are asked if they can name any major negative events that happened to their parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, there is a significant increase in the number of \u2018No\u2019 as they move further up the family tree . Most of the participants started to lose track of the historical events that might have happened. The question \u2018how well do you think you know your family history\u2019 is repeated twice on my survey to find out how the activity that is carried out will impact the participants\u2019 thoughts. We can see this in comparison as the same question is asked before and after the activity. There is a reduction in number for people who voted for scale 7-9 after doing the exercise . We can deduce that after doing the exercise, participants realize that they might not know their family history as well as they think they do. After the exercise, there is quite some positive response that most participants have the intention, or at least not refusing to learn more about their family history. After the activity, we can see that more than half of the participants cannot find something in common that they might share with their ancestors . This is interesting to see as about half of my participants voted that they do not suffer with any mental health issues. I wonder if these two data might be related. Nevertheless, it is great to see that at least close to half of the votes shows that the participants start to realize the relationship between their family history and themselves. For the part of writing a description of their parents and loved ones, based on the data that I have collected, about half of my participants felt surprised after the activity . Thus they might have discovered something that they do not know about themselves previously. There are some people that feels uncomfortable , thus this might be something to take note of in the future sessions. Is this feeling of discomfort beneficial for the activity or should we aim for reducing the discomfort? Most of my participants learned something new about themselves after carrying out this activity. Most of my participants are interested to find out more information about their family history after this exercise. Atleast about half of the participants might have experience some change in how the perceive themselves after this activity. Last but not least, there is no negative feedback for the desire to participate in an activity like this in future. Based on the activity, it is evident that Not all people is open to talk about their family. Some space and privacy might be needed should a bigger group of workshops be conducted, or perhaps it is better if we have a private group eg: a group of friends that know each other and are comfortable in sharing these. Conclusion Overall, this is an interesting experience for me as it is uncomfortable, especially for me to ask strangers that I have just been talking to for a few days to participate in this activity. It also took me some time to design this as in the beginning, I planned to collect the deliverables (their family tree and their descriptions of their loved ones). However, I find that maybe it is too personal for me to have access to all the information. Thus, I switched it up and used a google form instead so that the participants can participate without disclosing their family history. I prefer to do this activity with someone that I know well. However, I extended out of my comfort zone as most of my participants are randomly selected. This also helps me to put things into perspective, and ensure the compatibility of this activity for a group of strangers. For future prospective intervention, I would still be interested in finding subtle ways to intervene with the healing process. I hope that it would be a small move, but leaves a big impact to the participants. I also hope that in my future prototype or design, I can provide options to the participants to take charge in designing their own healing and restorative process.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term01/00-designstudio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term01/00-designstudio/#reflections","text":"","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term01/00-designstudio/#research-and-prototyping","text":"Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on \u201cyour poster, your vision, and desired professional identity\u201d.

Vision, collaboration plan and personal development Create your own personal development plan for the master (1 st Trimester). Create your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge, and attitude. Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge, and attitude Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). Justify and describe your personal development plan for the master program. Part A \u00b6 Something that I have always felt strongly about is issues related to mental health. Emotional pain from trauma or depression can be detrimental, yet it is not always being taken seriously. It\u2019s important to recognize that early mental health symptoms are pointing towards a more serious illness. Many people ignore their symptoms as they are afraid to be stigmatized. Most of the time, we\u2019re waiting for something terrible to happen, such as suicide, overdose, violent outburst, or heart attack before we take things seriously and do anything. This picture shows what depression might look like for those who have never experienced it. Things that seem mundane to normal people can be very difficult for those who are suffering with mental illness. People with depression might find it difficult to see things as it is, for example: the sky, without being swallowed by their own thoughts, assumptions and thinking patterns. Mental illness is common, but care is lacking. The window serves as a reminder that things can get better. There is always hope no matter how bad the situation is. One day, people will heal from depression, and they can just look at the sky and see the sky as it is. There will be a day when they can just look back at their sufferings, and smile because they get through it. The battle against mental illness is a long fight, and it requires the right kind of treatment and the proactivity of the patient in order to heal effectively. I hope that mental health treatment and services will be more accessible and affordable. I think when we are talking about helping others and contributing to society, it is important to draw attention internally to ourselves first. This is because when you\u2019re whole and healthy, then only you will have the capacity to help others and take care of the well-being of the surroundings. Part B \u00b6 While my fight are issues related to mental health, I am also passionate about resource management and circular economy. With this in mind, I made this development plan for this trimester. I speculated some major issues that I might encounter through this process. I hope to contribute by designing a product that aids the circular economy. Thus, I am interested in systematic design for effective resource management in each city. In the near future, most consumers will be consuming local produce and materials, and be able to recycle waste effectively. During the meetings with \u00c7a\u011fsun, Ahmed, Myrto, Seher and Stella, it was encouraging to learn that everybody comes from a diverse background with several years of professional experiences, some of them share similar visions as I do. One of them have encouraged me to continue developing my projects on mental health related issues since it meant so much to me. I suffered with trauma, depression, anxiety and personality disorder, thus I worried that I lost myself and get too personal in the process. While I am not entirely certain that my project will be related to mental health issues, I will be incorporating some mental health goals for myself for this part of the assignment. I am a UIUX designer with an Architecture background. I was a teacher in an international school. Furthermore, I am also an illustrator that is planning on publishing children books, and a co-founder for a small home bakery start-up in Malaysia. These are the core skills and knowledge that I have professionally. Through this masters program, my prospective future plan is to build up my skill set and portfolio catering more towards a UX designer/researcher direction while getting a holistic view to the emergent future industries. Generally, based on my experience, I am confident that as long as I put my mind into something, I would be able to achieve it. What pulls me back from success and happiness are the words that I tell myself subconsciously and thoughts in my head. Thus, for the future desired attitude, I will be focusing on spiritual enlightenment, finding inner peace, and self acceptance. I have included a personal goals section. These are collective things that I do that made me genuinely happy. These are also something that will help me to recharge and be a source of creativity when I am feeling down. Deep down, I just wanted to be happy and find a sense of purpose. Overall, I will be working towards resource management, with an interest in food source, compost, and recycling within a city. I am open for changes and alterations, but this would be the roadmap that will guide me throughout the trimester. I also hope that while learning about all the new skills and knowledge, I will be able to build up my portfolio as a UX designer catering towards a more UX and research perspective.

Emotional pain from trauma or depression can be detrimental, yet it is not always being taken seriously. It\u2019s important to recognize that early mental health symptoms are pointing towards a more serious illness. Many people ignore their symptoms as they are afraid to be stigmatized. Most of the time, we\u2019re waiting for something terrible to happen, such as suicide, overdose, violent outburst, or heart attack before we take things seriously and do anything. This picture shows what depression might look like for those who have never experienced it. Things that seem mundane to normal people can be very difficult for those who are suffering with mental illness. People with depression might find it difficult to see things as it is, for example: the sky, without being swallowed by their own thoughts, assumptions and thinking patterns. Mental illness is common, but care is lacking. The window serves as a reminder that things can get better. There is always hope no matter how bad the situation is. One day, people will heal from depression, and they can just look at the sky and see the sky as it is. There will be a day when they can just look back at their sufferings, and smile because they get through it. The battle against mental illness is a long fight, and it requires the right kind of treatment and the proactivity of the patient in order to heal effectively. I hope that mental health treatment and services will be more accessible and affordable. I think when we are talking about helping others and contributing to society, it is important to draw attention internally to ourselves first. This is because when you\u2019re whole and healthy, then only you will have the capacity to help others and take care of the well-being of the surroundings.","title":"Part A"},{"location":"term01/01-bootcamp/#part-b","text":"While my fight are issues related to mental health, I am also passionate about resource management and circular economy.

Text: A brief 500 Words (1 doc page) explaining the areas of interest you framed in the Design Space.This can be done with the following guidelines: I. What are your main weak signals, and why did you choose them? Are they related to your fight? Do they represent areas of research you always wanted to explore but have never had the chance to? Are they related to your previous background and experience? How do you think they are relevant right now locally and globally? These are the kind of questions you can explore here. II. What areas of opportunity do you think they can offer? My Design Space \u00b6 Weak Signals in The City \u00b6 I have always been interested in issues related to mental health ever since having personally experienced chronic depression and anxiety. It was a really painful process and I wish that nobody will ever have to experience it. This is because when you are trapped in your own heart and mind, there is no place for you to escape, it is like a living hell. It is absurd that while there is so much air, you still get out of breath, spending hours and hours laying awake. I guess that\u2019s the reason why some individuals might choose to end things and give up on their lives. My grandfather\u2019s generation suffered from poverty and my father was able to change the fate of his entire family with seven other siblings through higher education. Therefore, from a young age, I grew up believing that education is the key to escape poverty, and the thought of \u2018I have to be a professional to survive and make a living\u2019 was planted inside my head. Therefore, I went to architecture school and tried my best to get all the required skill sets in order to get a job as a professional. As I switched my career path and became an UIUX designer, I noticed that I would still develop side projects related to mental health. I write and illustrate short stories that are heartwarming for adults, posting them on instagram, and have been running a website for two years. Although my drive for issues related to mental health is always there, somehow I could not find a connection and opportunity for me to connect it with my career. I tried to make a living with this passion, but it did not work out for me. It seems like the only way to do it is to be a counselor or therapist. This results that even though I am doing very well as a UIUX designer in my previous company, I am always looking forward to the time outside of my work to do things that I like. Since I am spending 40 hours (or more) per week working, I felt very lost and numb during working hours. Some might argue that being able to have existential crises is a luxury, because we have all our human\u2019s basic needs to survive, such as food, shelter and safety. Yet, we still suffer, just on a different spectrum. I think it is an opportunity for all of us to question ourselves, raising our consciousness to another level to attain a greater level of peace and happiness. When I started with the bootcamp poster assignment, subconsciously I still believed that my drive towards mental health is \u2018useless\u2019. I felt anxious when I was the only person shouting that drive out loud. At that moment, I was not able to picture myself pursuing a project related to it. Thus naturally, when crafting my personal development plan, I draw my attention to another issue that interests me: recycling and resource management. Also, recycling and resource management feels assuring to myself as there is a vision and direction for me to develop the project. When I could not find anything related to mental health in the physical card deck, there was a small reassuring voice in my head saying that it is right to just focus on recycling and resource management, and forget about issues related to mental health. It is more relevant to the future, and all the pressing crises that we are experiencing as a global citizen. Afterall, mental health related issues are too personal and delicate, and it is hard to see the profoundness of it in relation to the climate crisis. In terms of scale of impact, the climate crisis concerns the survival of the entire earth\u2019s citizens, yet mental health seems like a personal issue to me as not everyone suffers drastically from it. Things started to change after a conversation that I had with Mariana. As she suggested, I looked at the Miro board with the new digital card decks that were added. I noticed that most of the new cards that I have chosen have more connection to mental health and spiritual awakeness. My gut feeling is telling me that I should just follow my heart. Afterall, climate change and mental health are connected. There are studies that show mental health impact on climate change. It was an epiphany moment for me, as I realized that when there is a climate crisis or pandemic, mental health support will be equally important. While people die from drought, tsunami, covid-19, earthquakes, heatwave and so on; but remember this, people die from depression too. So I went on and develop my design space with a few area of opportunities in mind with my main weak signal, Climate Conscience. My area of opportunities includes Ideation and Design Centric research, Design for Social Innovation, AI and Machine Learning and Maker Education. I am looking for a way to make mental health support more accessible and effective for those who are in need, specifically on prevention and recovery. This will open up more research directions such as what causes depression, healing transgenerational trauma, the role of the subconscious mind in depression etc. The first idea that I have is the notion of a \u2018Crisis Box\u2019. The \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 concept arises from one of my therapy sessions. Individuals that are suicidal are advised to create a crisis plan. This normally consists of a pen and a paper, some questionnaire, and the process involves jotting things down, writing emergency contacts and preventive plans. Personally I find this process tiring and dreadful, especially for somebody who failed to see the purpose of living. I divided the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 concept for different stages. In the early stage, I will source recyclable materials and try to prototype a \u2018Crisis Box\u2019. I would need to do some research on what goes into the crisis box. At this stage, the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 will be catered for depressed and suicidal individuals. Then, if this version of the prototype works, I can create a laser-cut friendly template so that this can be scalable and has the potential of becoming a community maker\u2019s project. For this stage, I will start exploring the potential of \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 for non-depressed individuals as a preventive measure. This will also open up another possibility of preparing a \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 as a gift for someone you love. Afterall, everyone has ups and downs in their life. It would be nice that there is a prevention plan or things to do when we are grieving. As a community, we are not taught to handle grief and sadness properly, that might be the reason why some would resort to alcohol, substance abuse and other activities that are a health detriment. If this version works, I am hoping to collaborate with local therapists to utilize this \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 in the therapy session to see if this prototype can be useful in practice. In the event of a climate crisis, I wonder if there is an opportunity to make the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 a handy kit that can accommodate different mental health needs. I would also like to explore possibilities to use AI and Machine Learning, incorporating the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 idea into a digital product. I hope to study the role of AI in detecting depression, and coming out with a customizable preventive or recovery plan for future iterations. The second idea that I have is using art and illustration in healing depression. Pictures and art are a form of non verbal communication, there are studies that indicate picture books can improve mental health. It is a way for using pictures to communicate directly to our subconscious mind. One way of doing this is using picture books and children\u2019s stories as a means to illustrate values and concepts in therapy sessions. I am very interested to see if it would make it easier for the patients to take in concepts and values. I am still developing my ideas on this, as this is a side project that I have been working on for years. I tried to contact some publishers in the past, however the most frequent answer that I get is that most picture books are for children, there is no market for adult picture books. In spite of that, I will be visiting the Frankfurt Buchmesse 2022 this coming weekend. I still have no idea what I might do, but I will be meeting an experienced Malaysian illustrator that has published many children\u2019s books, and I can use the booth if I want to when I am there. Perhaps talking to her would help to develop my thought processes. Aside from that, another way of using art and illustration in healing depression that I can think of is through creating art therapy or expressive therapy workshops with the community. When people gather together and carry out activities, it will be an opportunity for them to establish ties, creating a safe space for emotional assurance. With my UIUX background, I hope to relate or create a digital product, so that it can benefit people that suffer with mental health issues on a larger scale. As a designer, I hope that I can contribute my knowledge and skill sets working with psychiatrists and counselors so that the therapy process can be accessible and effective, healing and preventing depression can be easier than it has ever been before.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term01/02-atlasofweaksignals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term01/02-atlasofweaksignals/#instructions","text":"Design Space and Weak Signal Design Space: High-resolution screenshot or multiple screenshots of your Design Space if it\u2019s too large.

Post two pictures of the seminar. II. Choose an article, discuss the article from a personal perspective by referencing some scientific papers on the topic. Bio Plastic Experiment \u00b6 Group Work \u00b6 Reflections \u00b6 This week, we experimented with raw materials and were able to create some interesting prototypes. One of these prototypes was a bio plastic which was made using materials that were accessible and mostly found in the kitchen. Personally, I found this process surprising because I was not aware that all the necessary materials were so easily accesible. This opens up a huge possibility to make our own bio materials as we can do all these without needing a lab. All we need is just everyday things and our very own kitchen. Since I took biology in high school and college, a lot of the procedures seem familiar. However, after the visit to the laboratory: PRBB - Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, I am impressed by the tools and materials that were used in a professional setting. I feel very humbled after seeing all the different type of experiments that were being carried out. It seems like a science fiction movie in reality. Overall, I think it is a rewarding and eye-opening experience for me during this seminar. My interest will be related to the human brain and cognitive science aspect of biology. After this seminar, I will pay more attention to publication, news, and accredited sources related to biology when researching topics that are relevant to my thesis. Article \u00b6 The article that I have chosen is called Unboxing Mental Health . Article Link It argues that the current mental health diagnosing system is not efficient. This is because it is inappropriate to classify collective mundane experiences into convenient diagnostic categories. Furthermore, there is often stigmatization associating to certain diagnostic labels such as some personality disorders, which was associated more on the personality of the person rather than early childhood trauma or experiences. While the author argues that the transdiagnostic model might be a pleasurable alternative, there is still work that needs to be done before deciding this would be the solution and future for psychotherapy treatments. First, what is a transdiagnostic model? A transdiagnostic perspective is through discovering the common \u2018processes\u2019 and \u2018mechanisms\u2019 across different psychological disorders, you will have a universal shared approach in treating them. This is a process to predict a generalized factor which may be the root cause of psychological disorder. The process may include attention focus/ bias, pervasive beliefs, distress intolerance, worry or preoccupation and so on. Video Reference: What is the Transdiagnostic Approach to Mental Health? Transdiagnostic Psychological Interventions: Why Do It Any Other Way? The article spoke to me as I had experience in being diagnosed with a personality disorder and the process feels unreal to me. I remember back then I filled in an 8 question quiz in less than 10 minutes after talking to the psychiatrist. After seeing the results, I was labeled \u2018mild\u2019 with that particular personality disorder. Then there are certain treatments methods including medications and plans which sounds a lot like normal advice that anyone would give to those who are in pain. It makes me ponder: just because I happen to be at my lowest point in my life at that moment and have traits that match to some checklist, then I was perceived as someone that is mentally ill, I become a \u2018problem\u2019. Will that thought necessarily help in recovering? Will the results come out differently if I am in a good mood on that day? What are the standards to decide if a symptom is \u2018chronic\u2019? My experience is not something new among the people who has personality disorder, as through this research article , we can see that: \u201c\u2026the findings adds to the ongoing concern about the stigma, prejudice and poor provision of services for people with personality disorder. It states that consumers with personality disorder often do not receive an explanation of their diagnosis, or experience stigmatizing language and insufficient evidence-based information about their diagnosis.\u201d With that note, I agree that a transdiagnostic approach might be much more plausible rather than classifying patients into different categories of disorder. This will be a holistic approach, and removing biases and potential errors during diagnosis. According to this article , it supports the above statement: \u201coverwhelming weight of evidence from decades of such data-driven efforts indicates that mental health problems are best conceptualized along a series of continua rather than as discrete categories.\u201d Furthermore, according to Lisa Ekselius\u2019s research on Personality disorder: a disease in disguise, the other common problem with the classification system is that persons with personality disorders are known to be under-treated with respect to physical health and are over-represented in the group categorized as the \u2018difficult patient\u2019. There are initiative to make a shift focusing on the commonalities between different personality disorders, according to this article : \u201cThere is a clinical shift from an earlier focus on the characteristics of discrete personality disorder entities to an awareness of the common features of different personality disorder, the suffering of patients, and the many problems they face in interpersonal relationships and daily life.\u201d However, wIth all the positive points mentioned, there might still be some controversials on the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic approach for certain illnesses such as PTSD. According to this article : \u201cThere is no published empirical data comparing a transdiagnostic approach to single-diagnosis protocols for PTSD\u2026trials are needed to understand the effectiveness of transdiagnostic models as well as the comparative effectiveness of transdiagnostic and symptom-focused treatment.\u201d While it is undeniable that there are key challenges that we might encounter while adopting this practice, however, it would still be an improvement from the current classifying system. From all the data that I collected, I therefore conclude that the points where the original article mentioned that transdiagnostic models might be a pleasurable alternative are accurate.","title":"Bio & Agri Zero"},{"location":"term01/03-bioagrizero/#bio-agri-zero","text":"","title":"Bio &amp; Agri Zero"},{"location":"term01/03-bioagrizero/#instructions","text":"I.

Since I took biology in high school and college, a lot of the procedures seem familiar. However, after the visit to the laboratory: PRBB - Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, I am impressed by the tools and materials that were used in a professional setting. I feel very humbled after seeing all the different type of experiments that were being carried out. It seems like a science fiction movie in reality. Overall, I think it is a rewarding and eye-opening experience for me during this seminar. My interest will be related to the human brain and cognitive science aspect of biology. After this seminar, I will pay more attention to publication, news, and accredited sources related to biology when researching topics that are relevant to my thesis.","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term01/03-bioagrizero/#article","text":"The article that I have chosen is called Unboxing Mental Health . Article Link It argues that the current mental health diagnosing system is not efficient. This is because it is inappropriate to classify collective mundane experiences into convenient diagnostic categories. Furthermore, there is often stigmatization associating to certain diagnostic labels such as some personality disorders, which was associated more on the personality of the person rather than early childhood trauma or experiences. While the author argues that the transdiagnostic model might be a pleasurable alternative, there is still work that needs to be done before deciding this would be the solution and future for psychotherapy treatments. First, what is a transdiagnostic model? A transdiagnostic perspective is through discovering the common \u2018processes\u2019 and \u2018mechanisms\u2019 across different psychological disorders, you will have a universal shared approach in treating them. This is a process to predict a generalized factor which may be the root cause of psychological disorder. The process may include attention focus/ bias, pervasive beliefs, distress intolerance, worry or preoccupation and so on. Video Reference: What is the Transdiagnostic Approach to Mental Health? Transdiagnostic Psychological Interventions: Why Do It Any Other Way? The article spoke to me as I had experience in being diagnosed with a personality disorder and the process feels unreal to me. I remember back then I filled in an 8 question quiz in less than 10 minutes after talking to the psychiatrist. After seeing the results, I was labeled \u2018mild\u2019 with that particular personality disorder. Then there are certain treatments methods including medications and plans which sounds a lot like normal advice that anyone would give to those who are in pain. It makes me ponder: just because I happen to be at my lowest point in my life at that moment and have traits that match to some checklist, then I was perceived as someone that is mentally ill, I become a \u2018problem\u2019. Will that thought necessarily help in recovering? Will the results come out differently if I am in a good mood on that day? What are the standards to decide if a symptom is \u2018chronic\u2019? My experience is not something new among the people who has personality disorder, as through this research article , we can see that: \u201c\u2026the findings adds to the ongoing concern about the stigma, prejudice and poor provision of services for people with personality disorder. It states that consumers with personality disorder often do not receive an explanation of their diagnosis, or experience stigmatizing language and insufficient evidence-based information about their diagnosis.\u201d With that note, I agree that a transdiagnostic approach might be much more plausible rather than classifying patients into different categories of disorder. This will be a holistic approach, and removing biases and potential errors during diagnosis. According to this article , it supports the above statement: \u201coverwhelming weight of evidence from decades of such data-driven efforts indicates that mental health problems are best conceptualized along a series of continua rather than as discrete categories.\u201d Furthermore, according to Lisa Ekselius\u2019s research on Personality disorder: a disease in disguise, the other common problem with the classification system is that persons with personality disorders are known to be under-treated with respect to physical health and are over-represented in the group categorized as the \u2018difficult patient\u2019. There are initiative to make a shift focusing on the commonalities between different personality disorders, according to this article : \u201cThere is a clinical shift from an earlier focus on the characteristics of discrete personality disorder entities to an awareness of the common features of different personality disorder, the suffering of patients, and the many problems they face in interpersonal relationships and daily life.\u201d However, wIth all the positive points mentioned, there might still be some controversials on the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic approach for certain illnesses such as PTSD. According to this article : \u201cThere is no published empirical data comparing a transdiagnostic approach to single-diagnosis protocols for PTSD\u2026trials are needed to understand the effectiveness of transdiagnostic models as well as the comparative effectiveness of transdiagnostic and symptom-focused treatment.\u201d While it is undeniable that there are key challenges that we might encounter while adopting this practice, however, it would still be an improvement from the current classifying system. From all the data that I collected, I therefore conclude that the points where the original article mentioned that transdiagnostic models might be a pleasurable alternative are accurate.","title":"Article"},{"location":"term01/04-livingwithyourownideas/","text":"Living With Your Own Ideas \u00b6 Instructions \u00b6 I.

With this observation, I might rework the process if I were to redesign this grief coping method. For example, I will have the user that tracks their emotions to first list out whom their loved ones are prior recording their feelings. Also, while carrying out the experiment, I wonder instead of diverting attention to somebody else that you love, is it alright to recognize the fact that the person who caused you pain is actually the same person that can also bring you joy? This opens up another new perspective: using gratefulness to conquer grief of loss. If this is the case, who would be the target user?

Conflict and Relations Mapping \u00b6 I created a map with potential ideas. Collectively as a group (Sami, Ramiro, Cagsun, Antonio and I) we are interested in mental health, neuroscience, human interaction with tech and data, human habits and commodities. I am curious on how these points might potentially converge. The map shows all the areas of interest in context relating to the potential touchpoint with local communities. Mapping the Local Ecosystem \u00b6 For this part of the course, we were engaged in a role play to imagine how we can engage in community practice in the shoes of the stakeholders. As a group, it is an interesting experience as it helps to shift focus and perceive the project in other\u2019s perspective. This method would help me to negotiate and communicate with the stakeholders better, since then we can foresee what might be the point of interest for the related parties. Group Work Card Deck \u00b6 This was the card that I have chosen from the group work card deck. I would like to remind myself to apply this method in my upcoming design projects. I have chosen the card \u2018Seeing the Forest, Seeing the Tree\u2019 as it reminds me to perceive the bigger picture in any situation. Also, this shows that the any data collected can be used in many ways, and to know how to use it (whether to look at the summary of the data or individual choices) requires wisdom and experience. This also reminds me of a chinese quote: \u201c\u5f53\u522b\u4eba\u770b\u89c1\u6811\u6728\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u8981\u770b\u89c1\u6574\u7247\u68ee\u6797\uff1b\u5f53\u522b\u4eba\u770b\u89c1\u5149\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u8981\u770b\u89c1\u4e00\u9897\u661f\u661f\u201d It means that when somebody saw a tree, you have to be able to see the whole forest; when somebody sees a light, you have to know that it is a star. On a wider perspective, I am reminded to take a step back when accessing a situation because sometimes the closer you look, the less you see. Only when you are distancing yourself without involving personal emotions, then you are able to perceive the situation with reason without judgement. More on Group Work Card Deck Social Presencing Theory Workshop \u00b6 During this workshop, we learned that sometimes we forget that we can retrieve a lot of information from our body and non verbal communication. In fact, our actions are actually part of our subconscious mind. As a class, we have embodied assemblages of both human and non-human actants for sensing underlying dynamics and locating opportunities for action. We use \u201chigher educational system\u201d as a general framework and intentionality. It is interesting to see our 4D model as a cohort as each person might make a different choice. For my case, I was representing \u201cgovernment\u201d in the system. Therefore, I might project my personal experience while representing the actant. Both models, before and after, seem like an accurate representation of what the current higher education system is and what the \u2018ideal\u2019 education system looks like. The model that represents the current system has a sense of hierarchy in it, and the \u2018student\u2019 in the system is at the bottom of the hierarchy. In contrast, in the new \u2018ideal\u2019 system, the \u2018student\u2019 , depicting a warrior pose, holds an active role in deciding the higher education system. Envisioning My Intervention \u00b6 In general, I am interested in creating or finding a community that is interested in mental health issues and shows willingness to heal. Potential participants: Friends and Family Yoga Community in Malaysia Seattle\u2019s Community MDEF Colleagues Language Exchange Community Context There\u2019s an ancient Hindu story about the gods arguing over where they should keep the secret of happiness. Afraid that humans didn\u2019t deserve or couldn\u2019t handle this secret, they debated where to hide it. At first they considered putting it at the top of a high, high mountain, but reasoned that humans would eventually be able to find it. Likewise, they might find it in the darkest forests or at the bottom of the ocean. Finally, an idea struck one of the gods: \u201cI know the perfect place. We will hide the secret of happiness in the deepest depths of their own hearts. They will never bother to look there.\u201d Most people did not know that we all have the ability to heal ourselves within us. While mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are getting common day by day, there is still not enough knowledge and tool kit available and accessible to the public. Current Situation Mental health is a very delicate topic, thus I am exploring ways to be not intrusive, gentle, at the same time allow the user or participants to have the option to turn back or protect themselves should they decided that it is not a safe area. The question is, how can we help people to reach this level of consciousness and bring them into the realization that they have the choice to heal without being intrusive and respecting their boundaries? Engagement and Limits I am exploring ways to engage participants on a deep level, yet there is still a restriction on creating a \u2018safe space\u2019 for them to be open for exploration, especially when it involves strangers. As mental health subjects can get very personal, I wonder where I should stop, and how I should approach the participants without being intrusive. Theory of Change If participants can realize that they hold the power to understand themselves better, and all that they have to do is to take the first step and being curious about their own history, perhaps in some way, they will discover part of them that was hidden. This is also a good opportunity for the participants to take some time for themselves. Design Challenges and Opportunities One of the biggest challenges is to reach out to strangers. I had a small community of people that I have been talking to on a language app. We are united in the desire to learn and be proficient in a new language, therefore through daily conversation and practices, we are able to establish trust, enough for them to agree and participate in this activity. Furthermore, this activity is participated by people from a diverse cultural background and geographic location. I also had the opportunity to meet some of them in person to see how it can be translated into a physical workshop. Experience Meeting new people with an open attitude in person and virtually. I am pleasantly surprised by the amount of impact of a small exercise to a person. I also have conducted some follow up interviews on the participant\u2019s personalized experience. Solution People have started to realize that they can take the initiative to learn about their family history and potentially discover that it is a starting point to heal if there are any unresolved feelings. Through learning about their core descriptive language, it is a chance for them to understand the narrative that they are using to perceive the world.

Theory of Change If participants can realize that they hold the power to understand themselves better, and all that they have to do is to take the first step and being curious about their own history, perhaps in some way, they will discover part of them that was hidden. This is also a good opportunity for the participants to take some time for themselves. Design Challenges and Opportunities One of the biggest challenges is to reach out to strangers. I had a small community of people that I have been talking to on a language app. We are united in the desire to learn and be proficient in a new language, therefore through daily conversation and practices, we are able to establish trust, enough for them to agree and participate in this activity. Furthermore, this activity is participated by people from a diverse cultural background and geographic location. I also had the opportunity to meet some of them in person to see how it can be translated into a physical workshop. Experience Meeting new people with an open attitude in person and virtually. I am pleasantly surprised by the amount of impact of a small exercise to a person. I also have conducted some follow up interviews on the participant\u2019s personalized experience. Solution People have started to realize that they can take the initiative to learn about their family history and potentially discover that it is a starting point to heal if there are any unresolved feelings. Through learning about their core descriptive language, it is a chance for them to understand the narrative that they are using to perceive the world.

Reflections \u00b6 Through this week, I was surprised with the high accessibility to the available AI tools on the internet. It has been a rewarding journey as I am very interested in this topic. Coincidentally, I happened to stumble across a twitter post here , which is a girl using her 8 years old diary entries to build a chat bot with GPT 3. Thus, I proceeded to try this on myself. It was a really eye-opening experience to me, and eventually I was able to apply this on my group project and personal project. The hardest part of this class is to find the right datasets for our project. We designed an AI listening companion for the group project. For this to work, we have to find models that could convert speech to text, analyze emotions from different inputs such as sound waves, tone of voice, body gestures, facial expressions; and then convert the AI response back to speech. There is also a limitation in the type of datasets that we choose. For example, if we plan to have the listening companion use body gestures to analyze the user\u2019s emotion. We might want to rethink using body gestures as part of the input as there are a lot of nuances and considerations depending on the culture and context. During the presentation, interesting conversation rises around the theme of ethics in AI. In my personal point of view, at the end of the day, I think of AI and technology as a tool. A tool is neutral and has no positive and negative connotation to it. One analogy that might help understand this concept is trying to think of AI and tech as a knife. A knife can be a useful tool to help make our life easier, or it can be dangerous to use for evil means if it falls to the wrong hands. As a designer, I think it is important to understand who we are and who we are designing with. This is important as it will prevent us from falling into the fallacy of assuming what we design is for everyone and it is the ultimate best solution. It is also crucial to understand that we cannot solve all problems and please every user: it is important to know who the targeted users are. We might need to acquire someone that has the experience and expertise in our team should we desire to design for people with special needs and marginalized communities. That being said, I would understand my limitations as a designer, but that will not halt me from striving to get closer to my aspirations: hoping to use tech and AI in therapy and healing. I will try my very best to help people around me. Even if it is at a really small scale, one at a time, as long as they are one tiny little step closer to find peace and happiness, I would be content. Another topic that was mentioned in our class is the reason why it\u2019s so hard for tech innovation in the care economy is because the cost of failure is somebody\u2019s life. I think this is very true, but it is profoundly important for us to realize that this is not limited to the care economy. In fact, every digital product that we introduce to the world can change the way people live, and might cause a series of butterfly effects to the user. Do we ever stop and think what would be the cause of all the high tech and AI products would do to us in the long run? I guess not, we just adapted it as part of our everyday lives. For instance, social media, cyber bullying and etc, they indirectly caused suicide related behavior. However, after learning about these news and real events, people do not quit using social media. What we can see is innovation and prevention strategies were applied to the product instead of banning them. In this 21 st century, we have to register the fact that we\u2019re in the 4 th industrial revolution, and slowly moving towards the 5 th , which is human-machine cooperation. Therefore, we need to comprehend better the relationship between human interaction with tech and AI, then only we could mitigate the negative causes that might come with these series of innovations.

Key Learnings Potential to use it as a conversation rehearsal tool for example to stimulate hard conversation. Some people find it taxing to collect information so if this would be a digital product eventually, we have to find a way to remove pain points. Concern of ethics, fear of being unable to tell the differences. Need to manage expectations. Potential to adapt functions such as identify patterns in user\u2019s behavior and communication style. For violence prevention would be interesting to see if the tool will be able to show the participants when there are red flags or when someone can be violent. Need to design full experience for the product to be responsible. The process of building the AI bot can be part of the healing process. AI was able to answer in another language. However, if it is not mentioned, AI will default back to answer in English. Might need to prepare a list of questions as sometimes some user is unsure what to ask. When asking general questions such as future plans, etc, we get general answers. When asking more intricate and detailed question, we get a response that will better depict who the user are as a person Some users feel uncomfortable with the notion of machines one day having the ability to write so humanly and eventually begets the question of what it means to be human? Especially if the \u201cGeist\u201d is so easily captured by a non-living object. Building the Futures This is an intervention where we co-creating and imagine futures with and for children in public spaces and schools in Barcelona. Stories that was created from the activity: \u201cA kid and a car\u201d - 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval. \u201cThe grass and the hat, and the sloth will go out of the hat.\u201d 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval. \u201cThe baby brushes her teeth, goes to the car and sleeps\u201d. - 3 years old, female in a park near Raval. \u201cA boy and her little sister, he teases her and the bees tease them\u201d - 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval. \u201cThe worm teases the baby.\u201d - A 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval. \u201cCars are bad for the future because of the gas, I prefer bikes, walking. The future with gas and cars is bad.\u201d - Group of 7-10 year old girls and boys in a park near Raval. They said the future with pollution looks bad. They seem like migrants, and are environmentally conscious. Had no adult supervision. \u201cIn the future technology and contamination are everywhere.\u201d \u201cBarcelona has no space for animals, animals should be free not in zoos\u201d. \u201cNature should have more space in the city\u201d. \u201cBarcelona is not very accessible for handicapped people\u201d. - 13-14 year olds girls and boys outside of school in Sant Antoni. Key Learnings: Hard to approach when the childrens are playing, and it is important to talk to parents first. There is no need for consent forms. Sometimes the kids can be too young , parents act as translators and facilitators. Places of transit are not a good place to engage with children. Very literal interpretations. Teachers bringing groups for field trips on site will not be a good option as they were busy working managing large groups time constraints with no consent directly from parents. Potential to drive workshops that can be designed for play. Potential to incorporate AI. Consider aesthetics and graphics when designing for different age groups. Kids from age 11-13 had better critical thinking skills and were able to make connections between images. We can potentially try using words instead of images. Potential to use pictures that the kids do not pay attention to as part of the data collected General Reflections \u00b6 Through my projects, I learned how to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I had the opportunity to collaborate with experts from their fields and I was able to learn from how they work. Secondly, I learned how to apply AI and technology on subjects related to healing and mental health. In the beginning, I thought that it is quite hard to relate mental health with current technologies, as research suggests that the use of technology, increased screen time especially social media links to negative effects to mental health. Right now, I think technology could be used as a tool in healing. Third, I also noticed that it was not easy to work with a subject that can be quite heavy and personal to some people. Therefore, I am starting to observe ways that can be more subtle and gentle. For co-creating futures with the kids project, we learned a lot through our intervention. It is important to just go out and try out our ideas even though the activity might seem imperfect. As we planned our intervention to have an activity with the kids in school, it is good that through executing it earlier with the park intervention, we failed early, and were able to try things out. We were able to learn our point of failure and the parents were happy to help us. This will help us to be mindful and design a better activity when engaging with school children. Next Steps \u00b6 Personally during my exploration last term, I was able to dive deep into the topic and encountered a lot of confrontation. I learned how to set boundaries to separate design interventions with my personal life. Even though the process is uncomfortable, my internal healing process is apparent. I was very honest to myself and after building the AI chatbot, I was inspired to seek closure with people who have caused me pain in real life. It was what I really needed. As a result of the confrontation and embracing it, I was able to release the burden on my shoulder that has been with me for many years. It is really unbelievable to see the quality of my emotional well-being have improved. I was able to see joy everyday and woke up feeling content, peaceful and safe. Even when there are negative emotions and events, they come and go like a cloud. I also noticed that I have developed a skill set to accept myself. I was able to appreciate what makes me different from others, such as my way of living, the love to spend time being alone, and not being sociable enough as an essential part that makes some of my talents possible. I will not be able to paint, to play the piano and violin, and to write stories without these traits. This is an important realization as I have always been trying to force myself to \u2018fit in\u2019 and when I failed to do so, I was trapped in an endless whirlpool of self-blaming. Being honest with myself, and being able to say no to what is not for you without guilt is a big advancement for me. Since we\u2019re living in a world that explodes with all sorts of information and opportunity, I think it is crucial to know what you really want to be able to dedicate your full presence and attention to. Time and attention is a scarce resource, so I want to make sure that for every decision I make it is a conscious and mindful act so that I am able to face whatever challenges and be accountable for the decisions\u2019 output. Critically observing myself, I noticed that my strong drive towards mental health is slowly fading as a result of my healing. I guess in the past I had a strong desire to be heard and heal. Even though I am still really concerned about topics related to mental health, what drives me more now are topics related to the brain, subconscious and the cognitive process. While I am still interested in designing a product that can ease and improve the therapy process, now I will start to wrap up the Inner Bot project and focus more on the group project-co-creating futures with children. I will pay attention to what this change might lead me to. In the meantime, I will be focusing on my new interests and see how it could potentially combine with my on going projects. I will be visiting the Bologna Children\u2019s Book Fair as an illustrator, and right now I am preparing a series of books that teaches children how to manage their emotions. Therefore, I think the series of intervention, my interest in cognitive science, subconscious and learning would help me grow professionally and personally to create a meaningful artifact. Updated Design Space \u00b6 My Design Space might look a little different than the conventional ones, but this is what make sense to me and I was able to work in this format better compared to the initial design space. Thus, I will keep building on my design space with this format. For full prototype of my design space, please check here 1 st Design Intervention in Context \u00b6 Deliverables Document the 1PP design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. Describe the alternative present scenario that this intervention is offering. Then, update your design with the relations you have built. Reflections \u00b6 As our first official intervention after our experimentation in the park, we carried out our first workshop in Collegi Sant Andreu (Infantil - Prim\u00e0ria) with 7 years old school children. This would be a 60 minutes workshop, carried out with 25 students. We will be facilitating the workshop where the children imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. We will be using magazine pictures and worksheets showing pictures of places, such as parks, schools, zoos, and etc. We are using \u2018local\u2019 images so that the children can familiarize themselves with it. General Observations \u00b6 Children at the age of 7 are very obedient when everybody is doing the same thing. For example, when the children are getting too noisy, we raise one of our hands as a signal for everyone to pay attention. As a result, every child followed the action and they were able to keep quiet and pay attention. Furthermore, when dealing with children, they have a very short attention span. It is hard to keep them engaged and ask them to listen while the other group is presenting. Children tend to speak freely among their peers and have an activated discussion. There is a difference between children age 7 and age 13/14 when interacting with an adult. Teenagers interact with an adult like a \u2018friend\u2019 whereas little kids will feel a little shy. When guiding the activity, as facilitator, we try not to give concrete examples so that they have more room to be creative and create their own collage. In the process of explaining, we tend to squat down so that we are at the same eye level with the children. Children prefer hands-on activity rather than presentation to keep engaged. I notice that when we are showing slides, some of the children start to get distracted, whereas when we are doing the physical activity, most of them are engaged in an active discussion. Alternative Presents \u00b6 As a team, our intention is to collect the ideas that they generated and work on it and continue to be inspired by the collage that they made. Questions that we asked ourselves include: Is there a difference between their interaction among their peers vs adults (facilitators and teachers) during this project? As a facilitator, how can we communicate with the children more efficiently using body language, expression and choice of words? As a facilitator, how can we collect children\u2019s ideas of the future without influencing their creative process? How can we move forward from what we have learned? What do we do with the data collected? We foresee a few potentials, including creating a standard workshop so that any school can use our framework, create some workshop materials and make a demo video so that it is more accessible to other schools, or perhaps collaborating with more schools to refine our methodology. We also received some feedback for improvement. Some pictures might not be appropriate for the children. While children are sharing, it is difficult for all of the other kids to see the collage. Children ask if we would be going back for another intervention. Next Steps \u00b6 We would be preparing for another intervention shortly for two other classes on the same day. To be well equipped for the next intervention, we will be refining our project by preparing more materials (pictures and worksheet), find a way to forecast the children\u2019s collage and so that everybody can see it during the sharing session, and also keep our presentation time short and quick. We did well in time keeping so we would try to keep that up. We will see what happens during our next intervention and decide how to move forward from that. Presentation \u00b6 Updated Design Space \u00b6 2 nd Design Intervention in Context \u00b6 Deliverables Document the 2 nd collective design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. Then, update your design with the relations you have built.* Reflections \u00b6 After our first workshop in Collegi Sant Andreu (Infantil - Prim\u00e0ria) with 7 years old school children, we decided to carry on a second intervention with modification. This would be two 60 minutes workshop, carried out with 25 students respectively The workshop will be almost identical with the previous one with some changes. The children will imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. This time, we experiment with two different modes: for the first time, we will encourage discussion with images distributed. For the second time, we would ask the children to discuss for 10 minutes and start drawing, then only we will distribute the images for them to add on to their collage. We will be using magazine pictures and worksheets showing pictures of places, such as parks, schools, zoos, and etc. We are using \u2018local\u2019 images so that the children can familiarize themselves with it. General Observations \u00b6 This time, children will gather around the table when we have a discussion on the story, most of the children are engaged during the sharing sessions. During the first group when we distributed the pictures before the discussion session, children were using the pictures mainly to create their future scenario. During the second group where we delayed ten minutes and encouraged the students to start drawing first, the pictures were almost not used at all. Most of the children prefer to keep working on their existing stories no matter how interesting the pictures were. From this, we learned that we could manipulate how we want the children to engage with the workshop simply by deciding the sequence of the activity. When children are engaged in an activity that they are interested in, especially something that they have put in effort to work on, it is very hard for them to change their direction or switch their attention to new materials. They will be in their own world. The end stories of the second iteration were more reflexive and of higher quality. With the collage they struggled incorporating all the elements and with no collage they could focus on their stories. Feedback & Reflection \u00b6 Need to think of what we would be doing next after this, do we create another intervention that is similar, or make it as a series of succession intervention? Children ask if we would be going back for another intervention, overall they enjoyed the activities. Need to have more facilitators as some time during the sharing session some children got distracted (need help from teachers to keep the children focused). How should we iterate the materials to package this workshop? Ie. eliminate collage Gender inequality is too complex for their age range, would iterate that section to talk about inclusion instead. Let the messiness of the situation jump in. Asking kids to facilitate the workshop. Let the project fly(?) Who should be in control? Who should not? What point could you actually be giving to others so that it can be part of the project? Next Steps \u00b6 We would be organizing all the data we collected. We will be documenting the different future scenarios created by children, and find some opportunity to use the data with AI. For example, using this AI Word Cloud Generator to see what are the common words that come up. We could also do one co-creation session with the 3 teachers + the organizer. We can also have a workshop online training teachers and facilitators so that they can carry out in their own school. We plan on using all the collective answers from the workshops and create a podcast format. Presentation \u00b6 Updated Design Space \u00b6 3 rd Design Intervention in Context \u00b6 Deliverables Document the final design intervention, analyze it and reflect on the findings. Update your design space with the relations you have built. Reflections \u00b6 The third intervention will be done together with the two micro challenges through the Fab Academy. Our end goal is to test out the prototype during the remaining time that we have and use the prototype with school children early next term. After doing the first micro-challenge, building a perception board for future intervention, I started to reflect on questions about my project in general such as to whom can I speak with, what am I doing, and is there any alternative materials to consider for my prototype. Also, after learning about radical situatedness, I also took this opportunity to reflect on my design spaces, micro challenges and also the collective interventions that we did. Context \u00b6 For the third intervention, Ariel and Jimena came together as a group and discussed our common interest. Based on our previous project, we\u2019re interested in exploring future perception and attitudes of school children. We have worked on a collage exercise to ask 8-year-olds their perspectives reimagining the future of parks, zoos, schools and sports. Therefore we would like to bring it to another level. We are looking into creating a prototype that will aid facilitating the workshop and also how this intervention could create a lasting impact to the local community with the absence of all three of us. Purpose \u00b6 What A \u201cperception board\u201d that allows children and teenagers to map their sentiments, attitudes and perceptions around global problems and their potential solutions. Who Our goal would be to integrate the tool into a session with teenagers (over 13 years old). This is because their capability to reflect on global problems is much more developed than on younger children and we are inspired by debate sessions carried out by children over 13 years old. Where Indoors or classroom settings. How This can be done through a workshop or a small game session with our Artifact. The artifact includes: set of question cards, wooden board, pointers. Why By showing an analog version of their attitudes, this will help because: If we ask one same question to a whole class, people will feel differently depending on the topic, their emotions that day and the knowledge they have on the subject. So it is helpful to document the sentiments that can also later be compared in future sessions. We want to visualize diversity in points of view and exemplify how points of view are flexible and can evolve over time. Stresses the importance that each thought can be challenged and evolved. Teaching kids to express their point of view in a diplomatic and peaceful way respecting each other. To create safe spaces for sharing their thoughts because it can stimulate difficult conversations. Prototyping \u00b6 Our game is separated into three parts: Question Cards, Pointers and Perception Board. We started with a series of discussions to prototype this \u2018perception board\u2019. To start with, we did a user testing with a digitized version on this Miro board. After a series of testing and discussion, we improvised it to better suit the children. Things that we improved includes: - Replacing numbers on the \u2018pointers\u2019 so that children can recognize it better - Reframe our question so that it is more children friendly - Enable participants to stack upon each other should they have similar opinions After testing out the concept digitally, we proceeded with the physical manufacturing. Initially we wanted the design to be a peg hole with a board. But we noticed that it is a problem as the same person could not choose the same position. This is the reason why our design evolved from the peg to the pointers that fill in the negative space. Integrating electronics. We want this to be meaningful and not just flashy or integrating because we want to add another fabrication technique. We planned on adding LED lights to help with wayfinding what is a Positive attitude / Strongly Agree in green and a Negative attitude / Strongly Disagree in red. We faced a difficulty to include several questions in one game, so we explored a stackable design and fine tuned our initial prototype. After a series of iterations, we finally came out with an MVP. General Observations \u00b6 For this intervention, we tested this out with our MDEF peers. - Most people seem to be very interested in the emoji\u2019s printed on the pointers. - There was feedback by our peers stating that perhaps adding a \u2018question\u2019 card so that the participants would have an option to use it when they encounter a topic that they want to challenge. - This could be a great ice-breaking board game. Reflections \u00b6 Generally, this game might be more suitable to young adults rather than children. We are planning on making the digital and physical version, so that even when we are away, the teachers or anyone who is interested can still be using it. We are also thinking of bringing this into the community sometime next term once we carry out more testing. Updated Design Space \u00b6 Exploring Alternative Presents \u00b6 Instructions \u00b6 Map, visualize and analyze the evolution of your design space over the 3 iterations based on ways of drifting, create a narrative in relation to your alternative present. Reflections \u00b6 Based on my experience, I think my design space follows an expansive model. This is because even though everything seems very disconnected, they are still very relatable in some ways. I think one point that ties everything together is my focus on UX and interests in human behaviors and motivation. From that, I was able to expand into different fields such as mental health, children activities, and urban agricultural systems. I will approach my alternative present in my personal perception. My narrative would be: Wen is struggling to find good UX opportunities as there are limited resources and faculty that are specialized in the interaction design field in the MDEF program. It seems that the program has a more emphasis on physical objects and engaging with the community. Actually what Wen wants is really simple, is that her talents would be able to be contributed in the right place at the right time. Alternative Presents: Wen started to find opportunities by looking around what is available to her. Instead of focusing on things that she cannot change, she starts to actively engage and look for signals around her cohort. Even though she failed a few times during interviews to get a UX design intern position, she is still able to use it as a practice ground so that she is able to be more confident in future opportunities.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term02/00-designstudio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term02/00-designstudio/#reflecting-and-reframing","text":"Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back.

Some people find it taxing to collect information so if this would be a digital product eventually, we have to find a way to remove pain points. Concern of ethics, fear of being unable to tell the differences. Need to manage expectations. Potential to adapt functions such as identify patterns in user\u2019s behavior and communication style. For violence prevention would be interesting to see if the tool will be able to show the participants when there are red flags or when someone can be violent. Need to design full experience for the product to be responsible. The process of building the AI bot can be part of the healing process. AI was able to answer in another language. However, if it is not mentioned, AI will default back to answer in English. Might need to prepare a list of questions as sometimes some user is unsure what to ask. When asking general questions such as future plans, etc, we get general answers. When asking more intricate and detailed question, we get a response that will better depict who the user are as a person Some users feel uncomfortable with the notion of machines one day having the ability to write so humanly and eventually begets the question of what it means to be human? Especially if the \u201cGeist\u201d is so easily captured by a non-living object. Building the Futures This is an intervention where we co-creating and imagine futures with and for children in public spaces and schools in Barcelona. Stories that was created from the activity: \u201cA kid and a car\u201d - 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval. \u201cThe grass and the hat, and the sloth will go out of the hat.\u201d 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval. \u201cThe baby brushes her teeth, goes to the car and sleeps\u201d. - 3 years old, female in a park near Raval. \u201cA boy and her little sister, he teases her and the bees tease them\u201d - 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval. \u201cThe worm teases the baby.\u201d - A 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval. \u201cCars are bad for the future because of the gas, I prefer bikes, walking. The future with gas and cars is bad.\u201d - Group of 7-10 year old girls and boys in a park near Raval. They said the future with pollution looks bad. They seem like migrants, and are environmentally conscious. Had no adult supervision. \u201cIn the future technology and contamination are everywhere.\u201d \u201cBarcelona has no space for animals, animals should be free not in zoos\u201d. \u201cNature should have more space in the city\u201d. \u201cBarcelona is not very accessible for handicapped people\u201d. - 13-14 year olds girls and boys outside of school in Sant Antoni. Key Learnings: Hard to approach when the childrens are playing, and it is important to talk to parents first. There is no need for consent forms. Sometimes the kids can be too young , parents act as translators and facilitators. Places of transit are not a good place to engage with children. Very literal interpretations. Teachers bringing groups for field trips on site will not be a good option as they were busy working managing large groups time constraints with no consent directly from parents. Potential to drive workshops that can be designed for play. Potential to incorporate AI. Consider aesthetics and graphics when designing for different age groups. Kids from age 11-13 had better critical thinking skills and were able to make connections between images. We can potentially try using words instead of images. Potential to use pictures that the kids do not pay attention to as part of the data collected","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term02/00-designstudio/#general-reflections","text":"Through my projects, I learned how to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. I had the opportunity to collaborate with experts from their fields and I was able to learn from how they work. Secondly, I learned how to apply AI and technology on subjects related to healing and mental health. In the beginning, I thought that it is quite hard to relate mental health with current technologies, as research suggests that the use of technology, increased screen time especially social media links to negative effects to mental health. Right now, I think technology could be used as a tool in healing. Third, I also noticed that it was not easy to work with a subject that can be quite heavy and personal to some people. Therefore, I am starting to observe ways that can be more subtle and gentle. For co-creating futures with the kids project, we learned a lot through our intervention. It is important to just go out and try out our ideas even though the activity might seem imperfect. As we planned our intervention to have an activity with the kids in school, it is good that through executing it earlier with the park intervention, we failed early, and were able to try things out. We were able to learn our point of failure and the parents were happy to help us. This will help us to be mindful and design a better activity when engaging with school children.","title":"General Reflections"},{"location":"term02/00-designstudio/#next-steps","text":"Personally during my exploration last term, I was able to dive deep into the topic and encountered a lot of confrontation. I learned how to set boundaries to separate design interventions with my personal life. Even though the process is uncomfortable, my internal healing process is apparent. I was very honest to myself and after building the AI chatbot, I was inspired to seek closure with people who have caused me pain in real life. It was what I really needed. As a result of the confrontation and embracing it, I was able to release the burden on my shoulder that has been with me for many years. It is really unbelievable to see the quality of my emotional well-being have improved. I was able to see joy everyday and woke up feeling content, peaceful and safe. Even when there are negative emotions and events, they come and go like a cloud. I also noticed that I have developed a skill set to accept myself. I was able to appreciate what makes me different from others, such as my way of living, the love to spend time being alone, and not being sociable enough as an essential part that makes some of my talents possible. I will not be able to paint, to play the piano and violin, and to write stories without these traits. This is an important realization as I have always been trying to force myself to \u2018fit in\u2019 and when I failed to do so, I was trapped in an endless whirlpool of self-blaming. Being honest with myself, and being able to say no to what is not for you without guilt is a big advancement for me. Since we\u2019re living in a world that explodes with all sorts of information and opportunity, I think it is crucial to know what you really want to be able to dedicate your full presence and attention to. Time and attention is a scarce resource, so I want to make sure that for every decision I make it is a conscious and mindful act so that I am able to face whatever challenges and be accountable for the decisions\u2019 output. Critically observing myself, I noticed that my strong drive towards mental health is slowly fading as a result of my healing. I guess in the past I had a strong desire to be heard and heal. Even though I am still really concerned about topics related to mental health, what drives me more now are topics related to the brain, subconscious and the cognitive process. While I am still interested in designing a product that can ease and improve the therapy process, now I will start to wrap up the Inner Bot project and focus more on the group project-co-creating futures with children. I will pay attention to what this change might lead me to. In the meantime, I will be focusing on my new interests and see how it could potentially combine with my on going projects. I will be visiting the Bologna Children\u2019s Book Fair as an illustrator, and right now I am preparing a series of books that teaches children how to manage their emotions. Therefore, I think the series of intervention, my interest in cognitive science, subconscious and learning would help me grow professionally and personally to create a meaningful artifact.","title":"Next Steps"},{"location":"term02/00-designstudio/#updated-design-space","text":"My Design Space might look a little different than the conventional ones, but this is what make sense to me and I was able to work in this format better compared to the initial design space.

For example, when the children are getting too noisy, we raise one of our hands as a signal for everyone to pay attention. As a result, every child followed the action and they were able to keep quiet and pay attention. Furthermore, when dealing with children, they have a very short attention span. It is hard to keep them engaged and ask them to listen while the other group is presenting. Children tend to speak freely among their peers and have an activated discussion. There is a difference between children age 7 and age 13/14 when interacting with an adult. Teenagers interact with an adult like a \u2018friend\u2019 whereas little kids will feel a little shy. When guiding the activity, as facilitator, we try not to give concrete examples so that they have more room to be creative and create their own collage. In the process of explaining, we tend to squat down so that we are at the same eye level with the children. Children prefer hands-on activity rather than presentation to keep engaged. I notice that when we are showing slides, some of the children start to get distracted, whereas when we are doing the physical activity, most of them are engaged in an active discussion.","title":"General Observations"},{"location":"term02/00-designstudio/#alternative-presents","text":"As a team, our intention is to collect the ideas that they generated and work on it and continue to be inspired by the collage that they made.

As a facilitator, how can we collect children\u2019s ideas of the future without influencing their creative process? How can we move forward from what we have learned? What do we do with the data collected? We foresee a few potentials, including creating a standard workshop so that any school can use our framework, create some workshop materials and make a demo video so that it is more accessible to other schools, or perhaps collaborating with more schools to refine our methodology.

The children will imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. This time, we experiment with two different modes: for the first time, we will encourage discussion with images distributed.

Most of the children prefer to keep working on their existing stories no matter how interesting the pictures were. From this, we learned that we could manipulate how we want the children to engage with the workshop simply by deciding the sequence of the activity. When children are engaged in an activity that they are interested in, especially something that they have put in effort to work on, it is very hard for them to change their direction or switch their attention to new materials.

Why By showing an analog version of their attitudes, this will help because: If we ask one same question to a whole class, people will feel differently depending on the topic, their emotions that day and the knowledge they have on the subject.

Initially we wanted the design to be a peg hole with a board. But we noticed that it is a problem as the same person could not choose the same position. This is the reason why our design evolved from the peg to the pointers that fill in the negative space. Integrating electronics. We want this to be meaningful and not just flashy or integrating because we want to add another fabrication technique.

Resources \u00b6 Lecturer Website Frederik van Amstel \u00b6 El Hacer Como Que Hacer Reflection \u00b6 This talk reminds me of my country background as Malaysia is a country that was colonized by the British. Personally, both of my grandparents from both parents\u2019 sides work for and against the British government. It made me realize how powerless we were and had to fight against each other. If we celebrate colonization as a notion of \u201cremaking\u201d, it is an opportunity for change. However, the western world has \u2018unmade\u2019 the indigenous culture. Colonizers changed the way indigenous people live by force, they steal their resources and torture the people. While I agree that colonization might still bring some sort of benefit to the country, for example, the British left the law and education system behind; it is still important to recognize the harm that it brought and how it was rooted from selfish desires. While colonization seems like something that happened in the far history, it is still happening here and now. Even until today, modern day colonization comes in different forms, for example tourism colonization, big brands and chains sweeping all over the world. Ultimately, as a designer, we have the power to create and change systems. Therefore, it is important to design with conciousness. We have to recognize what is already there first before implying or imposing our ideas to avoid being that \u2018colonizer\u2019 to our subject. As the speaker says, freedom is something that is not born, but something we make. When designing, it is crucial to recognize that we are only suggesting, not imposting. Lastly, we are remaking our past with every present decision that we made. This makes me feel hopeful and content to continuously fight for what I care about.

I still don\u2019t have an answer to all the questions, but I would keep all these questions in mind while doing my exploration.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term02/01-futuretalks/#resources_1","text":"Lecturer Website","title":"Resources"},{"location":"term02/01-futuretalks/#frederik-van-amstel","text":"El Hacer Como Que Hacer","title":"Frederik van Amstel"},{"location":"term02/01-futuretalks/#reflection_2","text":"This talk reminds me of my country background as Malaysia is a country that was colonized by the British. Personally, both of my grandparents from both parents\u2019 sides work for and against the British government. It made me realize how powerless we were and had to fight against each other. If we celebrate colonization as a notion of \u201cremaking\u201d, it is an opportunity for change. However, the western world has \u2018unmade\u2019 the indigenous culture. Colonizers changed the way indigenous people live by force, they steal their resources and torture the people. While I agree that colonization might still bring some sort of benefit to the country, for example, the British left the law and education system behind; it is still important to recognize the harm that it brought and how it was rooted from selfish desires. While colonization seems like something that happened in the far history, it is still happening here and now. Even until today, modern day colonization comes in different forms, for example tourism colonization, big brands and chains sweeping all over the world. Ultimately, as a designer, we have the power to create and change systems. Therefore, it is important to design with conciousness. We have to recognize what is already there first before implying or imposing our ideas to avoid being that \u2018colonizer\u2019 to our subject. As the speaker says, freedom is something that is not born, but something we make. When designing, it is crucial to recognize that we are only suggesting, not imposting. Lastly, we are remaking our past with every present decision that we made. This makes me feel hopeful and content to continuously fight for what I care about.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term02/01-futuretalks/#resources_2","text":"Lecturer Website Presentation","title":"Resources"},{"location":"term02/02-dnbs/","text":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds \u00b6 Reflections \u00b6 These are some takeaway that I had after the lecture series: Design with consciousness, visualize technology as data points instead of an abstract idea of cloud storage.

There are a couple of things that I want to assure you of. You are loved and some things take time. Sometimes the wrong train takes us to the right destination. Having 27 years more of living experience, I just wanted to give you some advice to make your life easier: Keep things simple, be kind and respectful to every living being, and cherish every present moment with your loved ones. Remember your principles and conscience. Keep doing things that make you happy, don\u2019t be afraid to be different and don\u2019t choose to blindly follow the road that seems safe; don\u2019t do things just for the sake of doing it. Follow your heart\u2019s desire and leave no regrets. It might be hard to believe this, but everything will fall into place like it\u2019s meant to be. Stop seeking, start living. When in doubt, close your eyes and listen to your heart, as you have all the answers and wisdom within. When people are in pain, or hurting others, or being emotionally unstable, or just doing weird things; instead of blaming them, ask what happened to them that makes them behave this way. This will make you empathise with their experience. Remember, we are more alike than different. Even sometimes somebody might have wronged you, deceive you, or you might be in a position where you were being taken advantage of, but trust me, you are always winning with the right state of mind. Whenever you are in pain or immersed in happiness, remember: This all shall pass. Take good care of your siblings, parents and family members, as they are the best gift in your life. Remember, you are more capable than you think you are. \u5207\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5904\u4e8b\u6b63\u76f4\u5584\u826f\uff0c\u597d\u4e8b\u591a\u505a\u70b9\uff0c\u505a\u4eba\u4e0d\u6015\u5403\u4e8f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5403\u4e8f\u5c31\u662f\u8d5a\u5230\u7684\u3002 \u52ff\u5fd8\u521d\u5fc3\uff0c\u843d\u68cb\u65e0\u6094\u3002 Live on!

On the first day, Albert shared this lecture slide . It made me reflect about my position as a designer in relation to my surroundings. Sensory Methods \u00b6 During the lecture with Zsofia, we explored methods to design with the idea of place as a sensory experience in this lecture slide . For more information and resources, check out the Padlet below: One of the activity that we did was to execute a sensory walk around the city. Together as a cohort, we contributed to a collective Miro Board. I have documented my personal experience, focusing on the sense of smell and sound during this project. Full PDF of the project can be found here . During the presentation, we have discussed the notion of sound can be so powerful as it brings back us in time. It allows us to access our memories and feelings just from some chemical substances. One feedback that I got is smell, like taste, is a very personal and intimate sensory experience - they both rely upon other means of communication to be shared. They demand dialogue and interaction to move from individual to share, even though they are experienced by all, sometimes simultaneously. Like the wind, perhaps they are made visible by their \u2018effects\u2019? Unlike sense sound and vision that can be depicted easilty with our electronic device,the experience of smell and taste could not be transfered to the user electronically. Another interesting conversation that raised during our discussion is to think of \u201cplace\u201d as a transient space, as an event that comes and goes, that is defined more by time than space. Does this make our sensory interaction and engagement more important, and our recording of something that is ephemeral? Place as a vanishing phenomenon? So, a place exists as part of our experience - but the experience of space is always changing and it is not going to be permanent. Digital Postcard \u00b6 We had multiple discussion on indegeneity. Also, we argue that indegeneity can be from a person but not the place. For example, if somebody is going to a foreign land, they could still bring a sense of indegeneity of their own culture to the new place. In the assignment of creating a digital postcard, as a group, we discussed about the iconic Sagrada Familia. Ironically, it is built for the people of Barcelona, but most locals think that the church does not belong to them anymore as it was bombarded by tourists. We created a platform for ourselves to share thoughts and ideas. Group Board Postcards from Everyone Using Design as a Tool to Explore Place \u00b6 During the second week, I am in group 6, collaborating with students from Germany, Scotland and Naryn. We decided to focus on topics related to equality, materials and craft and wellbeing. In the end, we choose human interaction as our topic. Miro Board We decided to have more flexibility in choosing our own action and see how we could connect each of our individual action based on our theme. For my action, I have chosen to use my on going project here in Barcelona to study the relationship between my action with the interaction with children. Context I am executing a small workshop with primary school children in Barcelona. We will be facilitating the workshop where the children imagine future scenario on topic related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. Action As a facilitator, our goal is to collect children\u2019s idea of the future without influencing their creative process. I will be observing the difference between their interaction among their peers vs adult (facilitators and teachers) during this project. I will also observe how can we communicate with the children more efficiently using body language, expression and choice of words during the workshop. Outcome Outcome This action should leave me with a better understanding on how to collaborate and communicate with children better from an adult perspective. This would also help me to understand how does children think and act, and as an adult, how can we provide guidance without influencing their creativity. This would help me if I were to design a system or educational content relating to children in the future. Conclusion \u00b6 This Winter School has been a very enriching experience for me as it allows me to connect with other design school students and exchange ideas. Also, some of the talks, notably a Talk by John Thackara makes an lasting impact on me. He mentioned that nature and tech no longer is an \u2018either-or\u2019 notion, we as designers have to accept that this has come to a time where we need to figure out how both nature and tech can co-exist. I have been listening to too many people talking about how we should \u2018go back to nature\u2019 and demonising all tech related subjects, so this sharing session has made me feel assured and inspired me to be a designer that was able to see clarity in all of our perconceived bias on tech.","title":"Winter School Indegeneity and Adaptation"},{"location":"term02/03-winterschool/#winter-school-indegeneity-and-adaptation","text":"","title":"Winter School Indegeneity and Adaptation"},{"location":"term02/03-winterschool/#reflections","text":"During the first week of Winter School from the 16 th to 20 th , I learned about the auto-ehthnographic in Design, Creative placemaking design and also Sensory Mapping.

During this seminar, we learned about working with real materials in context. There is a lot more hands-on experience and we are able to gain insights on how to work with bio materials. I have also learned a lot about fungi and have a new perspective of viewing mycelium as a material. It makes me realize how accessible all the ingredients are to make bio materials. This experience has been very enriching as it makes me step out of my comfort zones. As a group, we decided to use orange peel as the main ingredient. I was able to collect a large bag of orange peels from a local fruit vendor to execute the experiment. We have also explored different methods to work with the orange peels to give it a second life. We were able to use the collected orange peels to start an experiment. First we sterilized the orange peels in a pressure cooker for about 30 minutes. Then, we added some mycelium and mix well. That was the first exploration that we tried making new materials with orange peels. Besides that, we experimented with both wet and dry orange peels, mixing it with eggshells to form a dough like material to make our compostable flower pot. It is very interesting, as we also added tea leaves in one of the mixture to make our flower pot more \u2018nutritious\u2019. There have been a couple fail attempts, but we were still able to learn from our experimentations. During the second week, we also had the opportunity to learn how to 3D print using bio-materials,moulding and casting. I think both ways has it own merits, as 3D printing requires you to design and object from \u2018sculpting\u2019 perspective while moulding and casting requires you to think about the negative form that you will be designing. For the 3D printing, our group worked with orange peels and egg shell powders as the base of the bio materials. From this experience, I learned that it is crucial for the paste to acheive a \u2018toothpaste\u2019 texture in order for the bio-material to be extruded smoothly. While we also experimented to change the pigment of the bio-material using spirulina powder as an alternative addition, we failed for the first few attept because our dough is too rough. It is interesting to work with bio-material as there is a sense of instability and unpredictness, therefore we have to take all these into account when working with them to avoid failures. It was very enriching to see all of our other peers work during the final presentation. As a group, one of the feedback we collected is using silicon mold to make our pots so that it is easier to shape it. Also, we can look into potentials to add other bio materials such as coffee ground and tea leaves if we want to make the compostable pots more nourishing for our plants. If we were to take this project further, we would be testing the compostable pots in context to see how well or how long it will take to fully disintegrate.

As a designer, I think it is important to be able to sell our ideas through effective communication. What makes you different from the others and how do you want to work with other people? Without the skillset of presenting and understanding where you stand, it might be hard to work efficiently in the field that you desire. During the second class, they are inviting us to think of our work as a holistic thing. One example would be who you are and what you did. Also, with today\u2019s activity we would be helping to make sense of what we did last time and see the way it fits into the overall narrative. From this, we are aiming to prepare a communication strategy for the project. One of the examples that I find interesting is this project by a fellow alumni. During the class activity, we are required to write down our stakeholders/ audience and project that you have. Then, we gone through something like piority planning. We tried to fit in our stakeholders into different categories. After that, we classified them into different matrix. Last but not least, we tried to fill in this form to make sense of our overall project strategy. Assignment \u00b6 Purpose As a designer, I am aware that my decision could make a lasting impact on the user and the environment. I hope that I can contribute my talent while taking planetary well-being into account. Vision I will be adopting an ethics-first design method when considering the accessibility and usability of a product. For me, it is important to know that my work will bring a positive impact to the people and the environment. Mission I design with people. I will be bridging the gap between people and effective systems through empathizing and inclusion. I am aware that designers are not users\u2019 and they shouldn\u2019t rely on their assumptions of what the user wants or needs. A good design should be invisible. While approaching design problems, I prioritize usability-over-aesthetics, to me a successful design is when the user can get around the interface and achieve their end goals. Minimum Viable Message My research and project would be related to how to increase system efficiency while taking into account negative impacts of my work on users, consumers, citizens, society, taking the planetary well-being into account. For me, it\u2019s important to help the most people I can and hurt the least.

It is interesting as most of the design principles started from a european centric culture. From a UX standpoint, I couldn\u2019t agree more with this idea. Having the experience to work for both \u2018western\u2019 and \u2018eastern\u2019 projects, the notion of \u201cless is more\u201d can hardly be applied on UX project in China. In China, you will notice that most of the app is compact and full of information. It is almost like Chinese application follows \u201cmore is more\u201d concept. For this, I think it is important to understand it from the structure of the chinese character and english alphabets. Since chinese character are compact and able to communicate more meaning using a significantly less space, it allows the interface to accomodate more things. Moreover in chinese culture, we celebrate vastness and inclusion of everything, thus when an interface design is so called \u201ccrowded\u201d from the western standpoint, it works perfectly for the users of chinese region since they are used to the concept. I think it is important to look at the design case studies based on the context while being concious of the whatever design principles that we are practicing. In the end of the day, it is crucial to consider who are the users, the real people who are using the product rather then following the so called \u201cuniversal design principle\u201d which is mostly created from the western society. Week 02 \u00b6 During the second week, we had the opportunity to receive a guest lecturer from Peru, Beno Juarez. One sentence that stayed in my mind is how the value of the object is not in the object itself, but in the user\u2019s capacity. Using a pencil as an example, it depends on the user\u2019s imagination and perconceived notion to decide the function of itself. This is a very philosophical statement, but at the same time it unleashes one\u2019s potential. You are more capable than you think you are, most of the time, humans are limited by their own perception. The test of your favourite and least favourite animal is also an interesting exercise, I think it is like a psychological test in some way. Although I am not sure how mine would fit in the context, since my favourite animal is an owl and the reason I like it is because it is very wise, have good vision and able to turn its head 270 degree. Beno also shared that technology is not the bad thing when introducing it to indegenous culture, but how we are using it. I could not agree more. I have been exposed to many talks that celebrate the notion of either-or, nature or tech. It is the time to recognize that we are entering an era to co-exist with both nature and tech. I think it is important for the indegenious culture to atleast have some access of technology, and this would be a starting point, or an alternative tool for them to bring their knowledge to us. How can we bring nature back into the cities? What can we learn from the indegenious cultures, learning how to reconnect with nature? In the course\u2019s reading: A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things, there is an excerpt on Early Colonialism and Nature: To live is to alter one\u2019s environment\u2026While humans are an environmental-making-species, our organizations are fragile\u2026civilizations have emerged and expanded with more than a little help from the rest of the nature, and when that help is withdrawn, they can crumble.

Nature has been shaped into something \u2018cheap\u2019, like an object. Lands are owned by land owners, and they further transform how others could relate to nature. It might be a very painful but uncomfortable experience, yet we have to be concious that these issues exsits: the exploitation of indegenious land and culture, the history, the disconnection of our people with nature before we can decide how to alleviate the harm that has been done. Week 03 \u00b6 During the 3 rd week, we had a sharing session by Felencia Hutabarat. I personally find it inspiring as through engaging with local communities we are able to learn the organic and traditional way of sharing skills and knowledge. Her recommendation is to have access to an innovation lab, knowledge center, materials instrument and production investment. When it was Sudebi time for sharing, she mentioned that she refused to belong to a particular box. This reminds me of the story from Divergent, in the Divergent universe people are separated into factions with a specific ability. The emergence of the divergent community means that it is a sign of cognitive diversity, and it means that the community is slowly healing. Also, one thing that I remember that she shared is the idea to not be colonized by your own imagination. Again, it is important to have clarity and realization to be able to see further than what it seems to be. It is important to think about what are your specialities that make you stand out rather than thinking what people expect you to be and be that expectation, as you would be fitting yourself into a certain box. Overall listening to our classmates sharing, I feel that it is very empowering experience and I hope that in the future I will be able to apply the skills to the community that is relevant to my research. Assignment \u00b6 Instructions \u00b6 To write a blog entry of between 1500-2500 words at the end of the course on your website and design a vignette to illustrate the (some) following questions (feel free to replace them by more meaningful ones to you): 1. How design can reconfigure systems of extraction? 2. Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? 3. How can we design the transition towards these worlds? Submission \u00b6 In today\u2019s world of modern capitalism, it is easy to fall into the fallacy that we are living in a utopian or almost heaven-like world where resources, food and shelter are accessible to most people. However, it is important to realize that there are marginalized communities and alternative realities where millions of people are still suffering due to warfare, poverty and famine while we sat comfortably on our couches watching Netflix with a bowl of popcorn. As someone who had the privilege to have access to all the modernities and convenience that modern capitalism bought us, we have to remember that we are still living in a system that is harming our planetary well-being. The alternative reality might happen to our descendants one day if positive change is absent. To start with, we need to understand why the current system of capitalism that we are living in is harmful to planetary well-being. To give a brief introduction, a capitalist society emphasizes convenience, efficiency, and also a priority on money. Although capitalism is often associated with the coal and oil-fueled revolution, transformation in the food system came first. Without a food surplus, there is no work outside of agriculture (Moore,100). When there is a food surplus, there are other jobs available for the people to accumulate more wealth, and this would create a market for luxury industries so that there is a place for people to spend their wealth. Automation and bulk manufacturing also make products cheaper and more affordable. When everything is easily accessible, affordable and convenient, it makes the value for ownership of each object cheap and disposable. It is too easy to acquire food, clothes, plastic utensils, etc, thus when the object no longer serves its purpose, one can just dispose of it as easily as how it was acquired. I always believe in the notion that one has every right to purchase something, but one has no right to eliminate something that is in good condition directly to the landfill. The moment something is purchased, one should be responsible for its life cycle and should properly dispose of it. The problem that we face nowadays is that people can be easily manipulated through online ads, trends and influencers; companies rely on sales to gain capital, thus they are putting a lot of science, technology, design and talent into encouraging people to spend more. We are in this situation because the system that we are in encourages designers and engineers to put their talent in the companies to create and manipulate more \u2018wants\u2019, as this is how the modern capitalist society works. From my point of view, it is important to access this topic from three spectrums: government, system, and technology. Please refer to the diagram below to understand this concept better. In my opinion. only when these three factors work together in the best condition, that is when the change would be optimized and impactful. First, I will be talking about the role of government in design. Politics is a sensitive and complicated topic, however, as long as you are born into this world in a country, it is impossible to avoid it. Democracy is always celebrated as the ideal way of governance, as at first glance it is fair and even and considers the rights and the voice of most people. But remember this: just because this is what most people prefer and think it is true and best for the nation, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the decision is right or best. For example, just because everyone or the majority of people smoke, it doesn\u2019t mean smoking is good for the body. It is interesting to think that we will not \u2018vote\u2019 for what we should do to a patient in the hospital, as we would entrust the job to the doctors to diagnose them as they are the ones that are experienced and specialized in this sector, but for politics, anyone can be a politician. Someone in a position of power holds the responsibility to make the right decision. Thus, it has to be someone that is wise and non-bias. We have to accept that as humans, the majority of the people on this earth might not have the wisdom to make such decisions that will change the fate of the nation. That being said, the first thing that would need to change is the quality of the people in power that forms the government. The policy has to be made by somebody that is specialized, has a non-biased view, is selfless, and has the best interest of the nation and the planetary well-being. The way of governance, whether it is a democracy, feudalism, or communism is not the main concern, as in timeless history, we have already seen many successful and unsuccessful examples, of the fall and rise of a nation under different leadership. Having said that, we will move to the next topic: systems. In my case, I would see systems as an opportunity for designers to contribute their talents. Design plays a huge role in reconfiguring systems of extraction. Personally, I think redesigning the way people interact with their objects, will force humans to behave in a certain way, and if it is practiced throughout a period of time, it will form a habit. When it becomes a habit, there will be hope for changing the current system of extraction. For example, instead of asking why people are not recycling and forcing everyone to recycle, try to understand what is stopping them from practicing recycling. Some useful potential of applying this includes studying what are the pain points why some people choose not to recycle, and by understanding that, designing the system to support all the pain points that were listed. Another option would be designing the act of recycling to be subtle and hidden so that it can be something part of the subconscious behavior. Also, if using recycled materials is more convenient and affordable than using a brand-new material that was shipped from somewhere across the globe, automatically, the user will opt for the option that brings more value to them. From this, we can see that an effective system can play a huge role in improving our planetary well-being. It might not make a difference on a small scale, but if we can apply a good system to every part of the world, the impact would be huge. In order for the system to thrive, it requires proper planning and designing so that everyone can follow it without confusion. To explain this, I am going to use the recycling system in Japan as an example. They have their own mechanism for sorting trash. They even micro-sorted bottles and bottle caps for plastic recycling and they started this practice from the kindergarteners. Even though I have only been to Japan once and have not been separating bottles and bottle caps for recycling, but when I am in a system where everybody is doing that, even though this might be entirely new to me, eventually, I was able to follow. The same concept goes for vice versa. Imagine somebody that sort trashes accordingly. However, this individual is trapped in a place where there is no place for collecting plastic waste because this kind of system does not exist. That being said, we are putting way too much pressure on the individual to carry out actions, putting them responsible for the earth that is slowly deteriorating due to the greed and ignorance of capitalist society. While doing this might make a certain part of the population feel better since somebody can be accountable for all the disastrous catastrophes that humans will eventually face, it is crucial to shift back our focus on what we can really do as designers, to contribute to creating a system that thrives for planetary well being. For the third part, technology, and I will be exploring the way we can use existing tools to bridge the alternative present in approaching our desired future. We need to understand that it can be deceitful if one decides to work on a \u2018goal\u2019 in this context as the emergent future is something that keeps on evolving. Having a clear goal for the future might not be as helpful compared to seeing clarity in today\u2019s world relationship with technology. With today\u2019s tools and technology, what kind of alternative presents can we build that would lead to the desired future? In order to start this process, we have to accept that technology is everywhere. I am stressing this point as there are still some individuals that believe that technology is the source of all evil and we should go back to nature. I do partially agree with it, however, to see clearly what is going on in today\u2019s world, we have to fully comprehend that technological advancement is not something that can be undone. Instead of focusing on the negative impact technology brings to nature and mankind, how can we use it as a tool for us to mitigate the effects of tech disasters? What are the ways to make technology and nature coexist, and thrive together as a symbiotic system? While there is no one answer that will solve all questions, to start with, it will be helpful if we focus on the green industry. For example, solar energy, electric vehicles etc would slowly become more important when resources become scarce. When more talent and focus are being made on the industry that is relevant to the modern world\u2019s problem, this can solve a lot of the issues while at the same time promising job opportunities in this sector. Furthermore, I think technology should be applied more to system design and with a practical intention, for example using AI to calculate food consumption so that no food is wasted, or using technology to solve recycling problems such as creating an app that will bring people to the recycling point, to name a few. There is so much more to explore, by creating the desirable now, we are, in turn shaping our future. Having mentioned all the three important factors: government, system and technology, I think only when the three of them are in their optimum condition, that is when positive change can happen at a desirable rate. These three factors are important in creating effective change because they all contribute in working together and supporting the scale of the change. While it is understandable that this optimized condition could be difficult to achieve and there might be obstacles in some countries, it is crucial to not lose hope and continue to work on these topics so that one day, we can leave behind our legacy to our descendants in a positive manner. Citation \u00b6 Patel, Raj. A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things: A Guide to Capitalism, Nature, and the Future of the Planet. Verso Books, 2020. Reading Notes \u00b6 A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things \u00b6 These are some interesting quotes from: A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things by Raj Patel, Jason W. Moore. Although capitalism is often associated with coal and oil fueled revolution, transformation in the food system came first. Without food surplus, there is no work outside agriculture (100,Moore). Cheap food enables that expensive systems to yield riches, workers could be paid less, more calories with less labor, so more exploitation (102,Moore). Empire provided europe\u2019s industrial workers with cheap food though at huge cost to people in other parts of the planet. They guarantee neither that people are fed nor that they are fed well\u2014as the global persistence of diet-related ill health and malnutrition can attest (103,Moore). Two ways to keep that cost down were to pay immigrant workers very little and to settle them in company towns, which compelled them to hand back wages for housing and services such as schools, cut-price English lessons, and recreational facilities. Cheap oil is so important because today\u2019s capitalists don\u2019t wish to support the kinds of massive investment that would make a solar transition possible. Capitalism may have claimed the New World with guns, germs, and steel, but the New World\u2019s order was kept through race, police, and profits. These technologies of hegemony and order are the subject of our final chapter. The argument of this chapter is that capitalism\u2019s ecology has shaped the modern nation-state and vice versa, through the colonial frontier, through the interactions between early capitalists and \u201csavages,\u201d and through the technologies of communication that capitalism fostered at its inception. The ordering and reordering of Society through cheap things has always preceded by both force and suasion, coercion and consent. The limits of production, consumption, and reproduction are fixed only by the system in which we find ourselves. Such limits are neither outside nor inside but both, knitted together by capitalism\u2019s ecology of power, production, and nature. The individual footprint teaches us to think of consumption as determined by \u201clifestyle choices\u201d3 rather than socially enforced logics. If you have been gentrified out of your old neighborhood and need to commute an hour to your job, your ecological footprint isn\u2019t a lifestyle choice. It\u2019s a choice in the same way that English peasants, once kicked off the land, were \u201cfree\u201d to find wage work\u2014or starve. Worse yet, footprint thinking teaches us to consider the drivers of planetary crisis as grounded in the aggregations of \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cconsumption\u201d rather than in systemic dynamics of capitalism and empire. In defense of the footprint calculator, we might ask: does it not acknowledge the reality of our times, of planetary crisis, epochal climate shifts, mass extinction? Yes, but these modes of thought explain our present, disastrous state of affairs by consistently and significantly underestimating how the present is the product of a long past, of a bloody history of power, capital, and class, entwined in the web of life. At stake is how we understand population, nature, and limits. Steps to an Ecology of Mind \u00b6 These are some interesting quotes from: Steps to an Ecology of Mind, a book by Gregory Bateson. In the nature of the case, an explorer can never know what he is exploring until it has been explored. He carries no Baedeker in his pocket, no guidebook which will tell him which churches he should visit or at which hotels he should stay. He has only the ambiguous folklore of others who have passed that way. No doubt deeper levels of the mind guide the scientist or the artist toward experiences and thoughts which are relevant to those problems which are somehow his, and this guidance seems to operate long before the scientist has any conscious knowledge of his goals. In fact, the phenomenon of context and the closely related phenomenon of \u201cmeaning\u201d defined a division between the \u201chard\u201d sciences and the sort of science which I was trying to build. Gradually I discovered that what made it difficult to tell the class what the course was about was the fact that my way of thinking was different from theirs. I stressed the fact that \u201cdata\u201d are not events or objects but always records or descriptions or memories of events or objects. Always there is a transformation or recoding of the raw event which intervenes between the scientist and his object. The weight of an object is measured against the weight of some other object or registered on a meter. The human voice is transformed into variable magnetizations of tape. Moreover, always and inevitably, there is a selection of data because the total universe, past and present, is not subject to observation from any given observer \u2018 s position. In a strict sense, therefore, no data are truly \u201craw,\u201d and every record has been somehow subjected to editing and transformation either by man or by his instruments. If you are surveying a piece of land, or mapping the stars, you have two bodies of knowledge, neither of which can be ignored. There are your own empirical measurements on the one hand and there is Euclidean geometry on the other. If these two cannot be made to fit together, then either the data are wrong or you have argued wrongly from them or you have made a major discovery leading to a revision of the whole of geometry. The conservative laws for energy and matter concern substance rather than form. But mental process, ideas, communication, organization, differentiation, pattern, and so on, are matters of form rather than substance. Within the body of fundamentals, that half which deals with form has been dramatically enriched in the last thirty years by the discoveries of cybernetics and systems theory. This book is concerned with building a bridge between the facts of life and behavior and what we know today of the nature of pattern and order. D: Well, people spend a lot of time tidying things, but they never seem to spend time muddling them. Things just seem to get in a muddle by themselves. And then people have to tidy them up again. F: But do your things get in a muddle if you don\u2019t touch them? D: No\u2014not if nobody touches them. But if you touch them\u2014or if anybody touches them\u2014they get in a muddle and it\u2019s a worse muddle if it isn\u2019t me. F: Yes\u2014that\u2019s why I try to keep you from touching the things on my desk.

To start with, we need to understand why the current system of capitalism that we are living in is harmful to planetary well-being. To give a brief introduction, a capitalist society emphasizes convenience, efficiency, and also a priority on money. Although capitalism is often associated with the coal and oil-fueled revolution, transformation in the food system came first. Without a food surplus, there is no work outside of agriculture (Moore,100). When there is a food surplus, there are other jobs available for the people to accumulate more wealth, and this would create a market for luxury industries so that there is a place for people to spend their wealth. Automation and bulk manufacturing also make products cheaper and more affordable. When everything is easily accessible, affordable and convenient, it makes the value for ownership of each object cheap and disposable. It is too easy to acquire food, clothes, plastic utensils, etc, thus when the object no longer serves its purpose, one can just dispose of it as easily as how it was acquired. I always believe in the notion that one has every right to purchase something, but one has no right to eliminate something that is in good condition directly to the landfill. The moment something is purchased, one should be responsible for its life cycle and should properly dispose of it. The problem that we face nowadays is that people can be easily manipulated through online ads, trends and influencers; companies rely on sales to gain capital, thus they are putting a lot of science, technology, design and talent into encouraging people to spend more. We are in this situation because the system that we are in encourages designers and engineers to put their talent in the companies to create and manipulate more \u2018wants\u2019, as this is how the modern capitalist society works. From my point of view, it is important to access this topic from three spectrums: government, system, and technology. Please refer to the diagram below to understand this concept better. In my opinion. only when these three factors work together in the best condition, that is when the change would be optimized and impactful. First, I will be talking about the role of government in design. Politics is a sensitive and complicated topic, however, as long as you are born into this world in a country, it is impossible to avoid it. Democracy is always celebrated as the ideal way of governance, as at first glance it is fair and even and considers the rights and the voice of most people. But remember this: just because this is what most people prefer and think it is true and best for the nation, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the decision is right or best. For example, just because everyone or the majority of people smoke, it doesn\u2019t mean smoking is good for the body. It is interesting to think that we will not \u2018vote\u2019 for what we should do to a patient in the hospital, as we would entrust the job to the doctors to diagnose them as they are the ones that are experienced and specialized in this sector, but for politics, anyone can be a politician. Someone in a position of power holds the responsibility to make the right decision. Thus, it has to be someone that is wise and non-bias. We have to accept that as humans, the majority of the people on this earth might not have the wisdom to make such decisions that will change the fate of the nation. That being said, the first thing that would need to change is the quality of the people in power that forms the government. The policy has to be made by somebody that is specialized, has a non-biased view, is selfless, and has the best interest of the nation and the planetary well-being. The way of governance, whether it is a democracy, feudalism, or communism is not the main concern, as in timeless history, we have already seen many successful and unsuccessful examples, of the fall and rise of a nation under different leadership. Having said that, we will move to the next topic: systems. In my case, I would see systems as an opportunity for designers to contribute their talents. Design plays a huge role in reconfiguring systems of extraction. Personally, I think redesigning the way people interact with their objects, will force humans to behave in a certain way, and if it is practiced throughout a period of time, it will form a habit. When it becomes a habit, there will be hope for changing the current system of extraction. For example, instead of asking why people are not recycling and forcing everyone to recycle, try to understand what is stopping them from practicing recycling. Some useful potential of applying this includes studying what are the pain points why some people choose not to recycle, and by understanding that, designing the system to support all the pain points that were listed. Another option would be designing the act of recycling to be subtle and hidden so that it can be something part of the subconscious behavior. Also, if using recycled materials is more convenient and affordable than using a brand-new material that was shipped from somewhere across the globe, automatically, the user will opt for the option that brings more value to them. From this, we can see that an effective system can play a huge role in improving our planetary well-being. It might not make a difference on a small scale, but if we can apply a good system to every part of the world, the impact would be huge. In order for the system to thrive, it requires proper planning and designing so that everyone can follow it without confusion. To explain this, I am going to use the recycling system in Japan as an example. They have their own mechanism for sorting trash. They even micro-sorted bottles and bottle caps for plastic recycling and they started this practice from the kindergarteners. Even though I have only been to Japan once and have not been separating bottles and bottle caps for recycling, but when I am in a system where everybody is doing that, even though this might be entirely new to me, eventually, I was able to follow. The same concept goes for vice versa. Imagine somebody that sort trashes accordingly. However, this individual is trapped in a place where there is no place for collecting plastic waste because this kind of system does not exist. That being said, we are putting way too much pressure on the individual to carry out actions, putting them responsible for the earth that is slowly deteriorating due to the greed and ignorance of capitalist society. While doing this might make a certain part of the population feel better since somebody can be accountable for all the disastrous catastrophes that humans will eventually face, it is crucial to shift back our focus on what we can really do as designers, to contribute to creating a system that thrives for planetary well being. For the third part, technology, and I will be exploring the way we can use existing tools to bridge the alternative present in approaching our desired future. We need to understand that it can be deceitful if one decides to work on a \u2018goal\u2019 in this context as the emergent future is something that keeps on evolving. Having a clear goal for the future might not be as helpful compared to seeing clarity in today\u2019s world relationship with technology. With today\u2019s tools and technology, what kind of alternative presents can we build that would lead to the desired future? In order to start this process, we have to accept that technology is everywhere. I am stressing this point as there are still some individuals that believe that technology is the source of all evil and we should go back to nature. I do partially agree with it, however, to see clearly what is going on in today\u2019s world, we have to fully comprehend that technological advancement is not something that can be undone. Instead of focusing on the negative impact technology brings to nature and mankind, how can we use it as a tool for us to mitigate the effects of tech disasters? What are the ways to make technology and nature coexist, and thrive together as a symbiotic system? While there is no one answer that will solve all questions, to start with, it will be helpful if we focus on the green industry. For example, solar energy, electric vehicles etc would slowly become more important when resources become scarce. When more talent and focus are being made on the industry that is relevant to the modern world\u2019s problem, this can solve a lot of the issues while at the same time promising job opportunities in this sector. Furthermore, I think technology should be applied more to system design and with a practical intention, for example using AI to calculate food consumption so that no food is wasted, or using technology to solve recycling problems such as creating an app that will bring people to the recycling point, to name a few. There is so much more to explore, by creating the desirable now, we are, in turn shaping our future. Having mentioned all the three important factors: government, system and technology, I think only when the three of them are in their optimum condition, that is when positive change can happen at a desirable rate. These three factors are important in creating effective change because they all contribute in working together and supporting the scale of the change. While it is understandable that this optimized condition could be difficult to achieve and there might be obstacles in some countries, it is crucial to not lose hope and continue to work on these topics so that one day, we can leave behind our legacy to our descendants in a positive manner.","title":"Submission"},{"location":"term02/06-makingsenseandmeaning/#citation","text":"Patel, Raj.

Moore. Although capitalism is often associated with coal and oil fueled revolution, transformation in the food system came first. Without food surplus, there is no work outside agriculture (100,Moore). Cheap food enables that expensive systems to yield riches, workers could be paid less, more calories with less labor, so more exploitation (102,Moore). Empire provided europe\u2019s industrial workers with cheap food though at huge cost to people in other parts of the planet. They guarantee neither that people are fed nor that they are fed well\u2014as the global persistence of diet-related ill health and malnutrition can attest (103,Moore). Two ways to keep that cost down were to pay immigrant workers very little and to settle them in company towns, which compelled them to hand back wages for housing and services such as schools, cut-price English lessons, and recreational facilities. Cheap oil is so important because today\u2019s capitalists don\u2019t wish to support the kinds of massive investment that would make a solar transition possible. Capitalism may have claimed the New World with guns, germs, and steel, but the New World\u2019s order was kept through race, police, and profits. These technologies of hegemony and order are the subject of our final chapter. The argument of this chapter is that capitalism\u2019s ecology has shaped the modern nation-state and vice versa, through the colonial frontier, through the interactions between early capitalists and \u201csavages,\u201d and through the technologies of communication that capitalism fostered at its inception. The ordering and reordering of Society through cheap things has always preceded by both force and suasion, coercion and consent. The limits of production, consumption, and reproduction are fixed only by the system in which we find ourselves. Such limits are neither outside nor inside but both, knitted together by capitalism\u2019s ecology of power, production, and nature. The individual footprint teaches us to think of consumption as determined by \u201clifestyle choices\u201d3 rather than socially enforced logics. If you have been gentrified out of your old neighborhood and need to commute an hour to your job, your ecological footprint isn\u2019t a lifestyle choice. It\u2019s a choice in the same way that English peasants, once kicked off the land, were \u201cfree\u201d to find wage work\u2014or starve. Worse yet, footprint thinking teaches us to consider the drivers of planetary crisis as grounded in the aggregations of \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cconsumption\u201d rather than in systemic dynamics of capitalism and empire. In defense of the footprint calculator, we might ask: does it not acknowledge the reality of our times, of planetary crisis, epochal climate shifts, mass extinction? Yes, but these modes of thought explain our present, disastrous state of affairs by consistently and significantly underestimating how the present is the product of a long past, of a bloody history of power, capital, and class, entwined in the web of life. At stake is how we understand population, nature, and limits.","title":"A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things"},{"location":"term02/06-makingsenseandmeaning/#steps-to-an-ecology-of-mind","text":"These are some interesting quotes from: Steps to an Ecology of Mind, a book by Gregory Bateson. In the nature of the case, an explorer can never know what he is exploring until it has been explored. He carries no Baedeker in his pocket, no guidebook which will tell him which churches he should visit or at which hotels he should stay. He has only the ambiguous folklore of others who have passed that way. No doubt deeper levels of the mind guide the scientist or the artist toward experiences and thoughts which are relevant to those problems which are somehow his, and this guidance seems to operate long before the scientist has any conscious knowledge of his goals. In fact, the phenomenon of context and the closely related phenomenon of \u201cmeaning\u201d defined a division between the \u201chard\u201d sciences and the sort of science which I was trying to build. Gradually I discovered that what made it difficult to tell the class what the course was about was the fact that my way of thinking was different from theirs. I stressed the fact that \u201cdata\u201d are not events or objects but always records or descriptions or memories of events or objects. Always there is a transformation or recoding of the raw event which intervenes between the scientist and his object. The weight of an object is measured against the weight of some other object or registered on a meter. The human voice is transformed into variable magnetizations of tape. Moreover, always and inevitably, there is a selection of data because the total universe, past and present, is not subject to observation from any given observer \u2018 s position. In a strict sense, therefore, no data are truly \u201craw,\u201d and every record has been somehow subjected to editing and transformation either by man or by his instruments. If you are surveying a piece of land, or mapping the stars, you have two bodies of knowledge, neither of which can be ignored. There are your own empirical measurements on the one hand and there is Euclidean geometry on the other. If these two cannot be made to fit together, then either the data are wrong or you have argued wrongly from them or you have made a major discovery leading to a revision of the whole of geometry. The conservative laws for energy and matter concern substance rather than form. But mental process, ideas, communication, organization, differentiation, pattern, and so on, are matters of form rather than substance. Within the body of fundamentals, that half which deals with form has been dramatically enriched in the last thirty years by the discoveries of cybernetics and systems theory. This book is concerned with building a bridge between the facts of life and behavior and what we know today of the nature of pattern and order. D: Well, people spend a lot of time tidying things, but they never seem to spend time muddling them. Things just seem to get in a muddle by themselves. And then people have to tidy them up again. F: But do your things get in a muddle if you don\u2019t touch them? D: No\u2014not if nobody touches them. But if you touch them\u2014or if anybody touches them\u2014they get in a muddle and it\u2019s a worse muddle if it isn\u2019t me.

We have a basic overview on how we should choose the board based on what project we will be using. We also learn about different components on the arduino board. The goal is to find out why we need certain electronics and how we integrate it to our projects. For this class, we learn about how to select the right arduino for a project. How do we select the board? What are the aspects we need to think of? Is it the Power? Network? Memory? How to find it and what is the best for you? When selecting the board, it is important to consider the capacity. One quick way is to double check the microcontroller and search for the datasheet on the web to better understand it. When considering what board we should use, it is also important to think about how much power and memory that your microcontroller has. We also learned the difference between a microcontroller and a computer. Arduino is a lot of things but not a microcontroller, but arduino has microcontroller boards. Arduino is a brand of the board, and it is very amazing because it is an advancement for prototyping ideas. With Arduino, we are able to make prototyping ideas quick and easy. The Arduino hardware is completely open source, other manufacturers can easily copy their hardware. The difference here is Arduino invests a lot in their software. They offer us a very simple interface so that it makes communicating to the microcontroller easier. They manage to create a big community of people that uses the same spirit of sharing what they learn on the arduino. And some general rule of thumb when dealing with coding failure and debugging is to double check your wiring and codes. Try to divide the problem as small as we can to make solving the problem easier. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 For this class, I am mainly looking at the lecture resources shared on the arduino board. Learning Outcomes \u00b6 My personal learning outcome for this section is to have a more broader view in electronics and how potentially I would be able to use this knowledge to solve everyday problems. Also, to be able to run a simple code so that the buzzer will play. Personally, I am thankful that there is more flexibility for students to decide the depth of the technical if we want to do more research. 2D Design Tools (Parametric Design) \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 The class started with a basic group session to learn about the existing software knowledge in modeling. Group Miro Board on the first exercise We have a better understanding of CAM: Computer aided design. We also learned the difference between Vector and Raster files. Vectors are the geometric (mathematical) description of an image. Whereas Raster are mostly made out of pixels, there are essentially small squares and also a memory eater. Most photographs are raster files. The process of changing Raster to pixel is called interpolation. I find this interesting because when I was in architecture school, how I understood vector files is that file that has the x and y axis information. This is essential as when you are using another machine such as a laser cutter, the machine needs the coordinates to precisely cut where we want it to be. We also learned that computers are made out of CPU and GPU, and each of them process different file types. We also learned about mesh and nurbs. A mesh model is a collection of vertical, edges and faces. We learn that to form a design, it start with points > then connecting it with lines > joining the surfaces > forming polygons to create meshes and you will have your final model. This process reminds me a lot of atomic design . Atomic design is a methodology composed of stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. While it is not exactly the same thing, but I find understanding the parametric in this sense will make your design more accessible and give you full control to it. I also find it ironic that even though phones get better in showing the amount of pixels per inch, the human eye can only take in 200+ pixels. Yet, more pixels will need more memory from the phone. It makes me feel bad about this aspect of technology as they are using the lack of knowledge of the society in tech as an advantage to market their product. Overall, I find it very refreshing and interesting to learn about parametrics again in this context. I will be trying to create some models using rhino and grasshopper to test out some of my ideas. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources . I also did some research and reading on Zaha Hadid\u2019s Parametric Architecture . Learning Outcomes \u00b6 For this section I hope to understand better different file formats so that I can use it on the right machine effectively. Also, I hope to have a better grasp on Parametric Design and understand how it works. Even though I had used rhino and grasshopper and ladybug before, I am not really familiar in the concept of how parametric works. I aim to explore at least one of the tools for algorithmic design. Week 02 \u00b6 2D Fabrication (Laser, Vinyl) \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 The class started with a basic group session to learn about the technologies in laser cut projects. Group Miro Board on the first exercise For today\u2019s course, I learned the different methods of laser engraving. We learned the different products that are made with a laser cutter machine. For example, laser engraving, creating a 3D model with the machine etc. Laser cutter is a CNC system, and also a computer numerical control (CNC) equipment. We use CAD, computer aided design to produce vector files. A laser cut has only two axis, which is X and Y, whereas a 3D printer has 3 axis, which is X, Y and Z. A robotic arm will be working in a 3D space, so it will have 6 axis, which are respectively X,Y, Z, A, B and C. We learned about how the machine works, as it uses light amplification by a stimulated emission of radiation. During the class, we get to see a demo on how it works. Each laser cutter machine has parameters, such as: power, speed , frequency and air compressor. The higher the frequency, the more energy will be focused on the same spot. The input geometry will need to be a vector or raster file. If it is an image, we can transfer image pixel to a raster friendly version. Overall, I think it is very interesting as when I did projects for my architecture school, there are different settings compared to the current machines we have on fablab. One thing that is notable is that my architecture school has all the materials preset in the laser cutter interface, since it is quite predictable what we will be using as materials. In the fablab, since we can cut anything and almost everything, we really need to pay attention to setting the parameters and testing things out. We were able to observe the Vinyl cutter machine and see how it works. The difference here is that the Vinyl cutter is not using light beam but a physical knife to cut through the projects. We also get to see an amazing drawing drawn by the Vinyl machine. Overall, I was able to make a few models from the laser cutter machine. It was a fun experience. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources . I got my vector files from here , and click here to download the rhino file of the 3D Sphere . Learning Outcomes \u00b6 I think the key takeaway from this lesson is to learn how to communicate with the machine so that you can execute your design ideas. Also, to consider mutiple spectrum when designing a product, such as thickness, material properties etc as it would affect your project output. Inputs / Outputs \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Today\u2019s class is about sensors, inputs and outputs. The reason why input and output is important is because it will help us reveal the info. We also learned about automated system And a closed loop system: a system that understands what is going on around with the surrounding. An example for a non close loop system is a 3D printer. They have no input output so they could not tell if they achieve the movement or not, they will just keep going on even if there is some obstacle on the printing bed as there is no sensor on it. A sensor is a resource for the machine to infer what is happening about the environment. It does not necessarily have to be direct, for example to measure the air quality of the city, we can simply use a sound sensor. We can infer that the sound of the motor vehicle is inversely proportional to the air quality without actually needing a sensor that reads the chemical composition of the air. I also think the idea of sensor fusion is interesting where we connect multiple sensor and analyze the data. The idea of the amount of sensors our digital devices have sounds alarming, as knowing that our information is being collected at this very moment by big companies and we could not do anything about it quite yet since technology advancement could not keep up with the digital law enforcement. When going through the list of sensors, I am very interested in the pulse sensor as it makes me think of the lie detector. I found this interesting project here and here I also think the notion of using graphite as a tool creating non-traditional human interfaces is inspiring. As a Product designer, I have been doing a lot of design on screen. It would be really interesting to design an interface without needing a computer screen. It also brings people back to experiencing technology in a manual and direct manner. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 Arduino code for LDR Arduino code for LED References \u00b6 I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources Click to view Sensor List . Learning Outcomes \u00b6 I think the key takeaway from this lesson is to figure out what would be the best sensor to use in a project. By understanding the direct and indirect relationship each unique sensor has with the output, it will help us in designing the desire system. Also, there is the technical part where I need to brush up as most of the time I find myself struggling making the electronics work. Nevertheless, I definately think that working a cohort together helps in understanding the arduino better. Week 03 \u00b6 Microchallenge I \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Generally, I think this project creates a lot of opportunity for us to move forward. By making this artifact, I was able to gain more insights on what it takes to actually fabricate a product from start to finish. I also feel I am one tiny steps closer to electronics even though there is still a lot of room of improvement. The feedback we received during the presentation is very insightful, we really enjoyed seeing everyone to start playing with it, because it means that it is somewhat successful in terms of engaging people to start a conversation. Project topic \u00b6 As a team, we are interested in exploring future perception and attitudes of school children. We have worked on a collage exercise to ask 8-year-olds their perspectives reimagining the future of parks, zoos, schools and sports. Therefore we would like to bring it to another level. Questions we asked ourselves involved what we can do to bring the workshop experience to another level? What are the most important aspects when carrying out discussion based activities? One thing that we noticed from our previous workshop is that sometimes when the kids are having disagreements, they tend to find it hard to come to a satisfying conclusion. Therefore, we think about how we can make this discussion process more diplomatic and inclusive. Therefore, we came up with an idea of a \u2018perception board\u2019, and that allows children and teenagers to map their sentiments, attitudes and perceptions around global problems and their potential solutions. Perception Board Explain your contribution to the project \u00b6 In terms of personal contribution, we divided our jobs so that we can work together smoothly based on our strengths. Ariel is incharge of electronics, to figure out how to fit the LED into the board, and also part of the physical artifact fabrication, while Jimena will be working on the MVP, digital perception board, card and resources design, and also preparing the guides for the game. I will be in charge of mainly project planning, designing the physical artifact, documentation, and the Rhino File preparation. Even though I came from an architecture background, it has been some time since I used Rhino. For my design process, I started with creating sketches and paper prototypes to figure out the dimensions and the proportion of the elements on the board. Things that I take into account is the size of each compartment for the pointers, and also what would be the ideal size for children to hold it. I designed the pointer so that there is about 4mm off set space when it is placed on the board. Furthermore, since the distance between the scale on the board need not be based on a real ruler, I separated it based on the distance between the compartments. Since the whole board is a 500mm by 500mm square, I divided it using the mirror function on Rhino. To incorporate the LED lights, I made 4mm holes on the 5 points of the board. As a final iteration, I cleaned up the files so that they are ready for upload. As a collective, we execute main jobs such as laser cutting, assembling and testing together. We also supported each other when we were trying to make the board work. Reflect your learning goals \u00b6 I think as a team one of the struggles that we had is electronics. We spend a lot of time figuring out the electronic part. We started with a conceptual product to help facilitate activity with children, and we thought that it would be quite straightforward to put together. What we learned is that the design process is very delicate and could evolve through making. For example, our first design is a press fit concept with wooden pegs with different colors. However after trying it out, it doesn\u2019t work so well as when we try to incorporate other ideas. for the first review, they advise us to combine electronics and also think about what we do with the output of data. They showed us a project of kids documenting their emotions a day and making it into an ice cream. Also, I learned about how to plan materials more efficiently so that we don\u2019t waste time and resources. This includes having a modular design so that it can be replicated. For future potentials, we thought about using LED strips and also refining our product by designing a card holder for our artifacts. In conclusion, this is a very enriching experience for me and I love our team\u2019s synergy. We are able to work together as a team efficiently at the same time, learning from each other. We will take all the reviews and feedback into account, and we are excited to bring our project to the next phase. We can consider adding question or wild card References \u00b6 Group GitHub Link HackMD Other Group\u2019s Repo Course Miro Microchallenge Website Week 04 \u00b6 3D Scanning & 3D Softwares \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 The class started with a basic group discussion to learn about the technologies and manufacturing methods. Group Miro Board on the first exercise For me, it is surprising to learn that a 3D printer can be built from scratch with materials from your garage and an arduino board. We learned about 3D printing tech such as FDM and SLA. There is almost everything that we can print. One interesting technique that caught my attention is the Laminated Object Manufacturing . It is interesting to see how thin each layer can be to make a 3 dimensional object. There are also some interesting resources that was shared with us: Reprap website : 3D printer world\u2019s wikipedia. A netflix documentary called: Print The Legend, showing how an open source company changed to a closed one. In terms of technical knowledge, we learned that to 3D print something, it is important to be able to subdivide the object into multiple sections. There is also two types of bonding, by heat or through chemical bond. Some popular 3D printing tech are FDM, SLA, and 3DP. The route of file transfering will take from an STL file, to a Slicer, and then lastly to a 3D printer. There is a flexibility to choose how big is the layer, layer height and etc. For the infill type, there are 4 main structure: rectangular, triangular or diagrid, wiggle and honey comb. I learned that support is important when printing occurs in air, or if the light needs time etc depending on the time needed for the plastic to cool down. There are many different software that provides design optimized support calculation. It is also very important to keep moisture from material to avoid air bubble. For 3D scanning, it is important because it can help represent the real world to the virtual environment. Overall, I find the new knowledge very interesting and I am grateful to be able to learn about it. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources . I am interested to experiment with this if I have more time. Learning Outcomes \u00b6 I think the key takeaway from this lesson is to learn how to use a 3D scanner software and how can I apply this in real life. Question I ask myself includes when would I want to scan an object and print the exact same thing? I would imagine that it is something that has an organic shape, difficult to be drawn in a vector software or some prototype that is hard to manufacture using a laser cutter. Networking and Communications \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 For this class, I was absent as I was sick, so I self studied and try to understand this based on what was shared on the website. Before this, I have some basic experience and understanding as I was working as a Design Technology Instructor in an international school. We were having a small experiment using the arduino board, connecting to a wifi to control the switch of a light bulb. Even though I don\u2019t remember the details, the concept is similar to what I studied from the HackMD website. A network (in the context of this class) is a set of devices connected to each other through any type of communication lines that allows the exchange of data between them. To understand what is an OSI Model , I have also find some helpful resources that helps me a lot in understanding the concept. Youtube Video on OSI Model I think generally I understand the concept. In terms of pracitical application, I find myself struggle a little bit. I will try my best and connect with my peers to see if I can figure it out. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources Learning Outcomes \u00b6 The key learning outcome is to understand the concept of network in this class and being able to set up a simple device or through arduino so that they can exchange data between each other. It would be a plus point if I can apply this on my household appliances. Week 05 \u00b6 Interfaces - Machines Interactions \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Today, class started with a lot of hands on work. We saw some examples using LED and arduino in different projects. Then, we proceeded to do some warm up activities. It is very interesting and fun! We enjoyed looking the LED breathe, it is like they are talking to each other. Personally, I prefer doing hands on work during class versus listening to the concept because I feel supported. We also learn about MQTT, a protocol that use in the IoT world. The concept is really simple, we will have a server that is called an MQTT-Broker, and it will recieve things and sense things. We will also have publisher (sensor) that can be anything, it could also be a computer. Subscriber will be the devices that listen to the program and they are waiting for the broker to tell them what to do. Lastly, the class is wrapped up with learning about Node Red . A raspberry pi is a simple computer. It is very difficult to get it now with the War and supply chain issue going on, but is a really good starting point to work with computer and server. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 I got most of my resources from the course website . Finalized Code Blink Blink Custom Blink Jled Server Blink Server Blink Advanced Learning Outcomes \u00b6 For this class, I hope to fix my arduino issues, having a basic understanding on how to control LED lights with a Arduino Board. CNC \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Today we learn about CNC. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software dictates the movement of factory tools and machinery. Some facts include CNC products are normally huge, create more waste and have a little filet. The output product could also be more durable. The machines are normally quite heavy, weighing a lot of tons. The different types of cuts for CNC and normally it is meant for professional use. It works with 3 axes thus we would be able to do 3D / 2D cuts. Or, 2.5D, which is something similar to carving. It also has a benefit of accuracy. CNC has more accuracy compared to other methods. I am also surprised to learn about a handheld CNC machine, but the accuracy really depends on the user. We also learn about different parts of the CNC part, normally the lower part has a T slot that will help to hold the material. We also learn about the safety knowledge of handling a CNC. Especially when dealing with collet, it is extremely dangerous as it is a metal that rotates at high speed. It is important to make sure that we are using the right collet with the desired dimension. To do it nicely, we need about 6-8 screws to make sure everything goes smoothly. There are also different cutting styles for CNC. These are respectively On, Out, and In. Normally, a nesting strategy should be applied because it is expensive and more durable. This will avoid wastage and increase efficiency. If we are out-cutting, it is safe to leave about 22mm spaces between the material. One helpful resource is svgnest . Also, remember that drills are not mills. It is crucial to understand this because they look very similar. Drill is for cutting vertically and end mill is designed for cutting laterally. There are three family of mills, which is respectively flat, round/ball or v/special mill. Round mill are usually for finishing and flat is for rough cutting. The special mills are used for marking and cutomized design. The direction of the mill depends on the clock wise or anti-clockwise rotation, climb or conventional. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 References \u00b6 I got most of my resources from the course website . Learning Outcomes \u00b6 Through this class, I hope that I will have more confidence when handling CNC machines. I had some experience learning about it in architecture school but not really handling it. Also, I hope to use this knowledge and build something related to our collective intervention. Week 06 \u00b6 Microchallenge II \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Generally, I think this project creates an opportunity to take our project to the next level. We are able to incoporate new system to our existing project, and at the same time explore new tools that make our project meaningful. Project topic \u00b6 As a team, we are interested in exploring future perception and attitudes of school children. Now, we are planning to bring this project to another level by incorporating different layers of element to our exisitng sturcture. It is quite challenging as we would need to compile the project together without over complicate the process. We also hope that this project can remain children friendly despite the extensive plan. Perception Board VII Image to be uploaded Explain your contribution to the project \u00b6 In terms of personal contribution, like last time, we divided our jobs so that we can work together smoothly based on our strengths. Ariel is incharge of electronics, while Jimena will be working on the MVP, documentation adn project planning. I will be in charge of mainly on project ideation, providing sketches, designing the physical artifact, documentation, and the Rhino File preparation. Things that I take into account is the size of each compartment for the pointers, and also what would be the ideal size for children to hold it. I designed the pointer so that there is about 4mm off set space when it is placed on the board. Furthermore, since the distance between the scale on the board need not be based on a real ruler, I separated it based on the distance between the compartments. I am also contributed to the design and crafting for the sensor box. Reflect your learning goals \u00b6 I think as a team one of the struggles that we had is still electronics Even though this time we spend a significant less time since we have a clearer idea of the artifact and pre planned things, it is still rather challenging working with new components. When we are doing the 3D printing for the microphone, we also struggled with the time as it takes so much longer that we expected. To solve this, we split the file into two different printers so that the total time taken would be shorter. For the CNC part, we also took an excessive time to figure out the digital files. We were required to make 2D of the file so that it is readable. Then, we had to go through the whole thing through the rhino cam so that it is readable. In the end, everything turns out alright. It looks cohesive and we are quite pleased with what we had done. Even though there are some small accidents here and there, as a team, we managed to resolve the issues.

We have a basic overview on how we should choose the board based on what project we will be using. We also learn about different components on the arduino board. The goal is to find out why we need certain electronics and how we integrate it to our projects. For this class, we learn about how to select the right arduino for a project. How do we select the board? What are the aspects we need to think of? Is it the Power? Network? Memory? How to find it and what is the best for you? When selecting the board, it is important to consider the capacity. One quick way is to double check the microcontroller and search for the datasheet on the web to better understand it. When considering what board we should use, it is also important to think about how much power and memory that your microcontroller has. We also learned the difference between a microcontroller and a computer. Arduino is a lot of things but not a microcontroller, but arduino has microcontroller boards. Arduino is a brand of the board, and it is very amazing because it is an advancement for prototyping ideas. With Arduino, we are able to make prototyping ideas quick and easy. The Arduino hardware is completely open source, other manufacturers can easily copy their hardware. The difference here is Arduino invests a lot in their software. They offer us a very simple interface so that it makes communicating to the microcontroller easier. They manage to create a big community of people that uses the same spirit of sharing what they learn on the arduino. And some general rule of thumb when dealing with coding failure and debugging is to double check your wiring and codes.

Group Miro Board on the first exercise We have a better understanding of CAM: Computer aided design. We also learned the difference between Vector and Raster files. Vectors are the geometric (mathematical) description of an image. Whereas Raster are mostly made out of pixels, there are essentially small squares and also a memory eater. Most photographs are raster files. The process of changing Raster to pixel is called interpolation. I find this interesting because when I was in architecture school, how I understood vector files is that file that has the x and y axis information. This is essential as when you are using another machine such as a laser cutter, the machine needs the coordinates to precisely cut where we want it to be. We also learned that computers are made out of CPU and GPU, and each of them process different file types. We also learned about mesh and nurbs. A mesh model is a collection of vertical, edges and faces. We learn that to form a design, it start with points > then connecting it with lines > joining the surfaces > forming polygons to create meshes and you will have your final model. This process reminds me a lot of atomic design . Atomic design is a methodology composed of stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. While it is not exactly the same thing, but I find understanding the parametric in this sense will make your design more accessible and give you full control to it. I also find it ironic that even though phones get better in showing the amount of pixels per inch, the human eye can only take in 200+ pixels. Yet, more pixels will need more memory from the phone. It makes me feel bad about this aspect of technology as they are using the lack of knowledge of the society in tech as an advantage to market their product. Overall, I find it very refreshing and interesting to learn about parametrics again in this context. I will be trying to create some models using rhino and grasshopper to test out some of my ideas.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term02/07-prototypingfordesign/#pictures-and-exercises_1","text":"","title":"Pictures and Exercises"},{"location":"term02/07-prototypingfordesign/#references_1","text":"I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources .

Group Miro Board on the first exercise For today\u2019s course, I learned the different methods of laser engraving. We learned the different products that are made with a laser cutter machine. For example, laser engraving, creating a 3D model with the machine etc. Laser cutter is a CNC system, and also a computer numerical control (CNC) equipment. We use CAD, computer aided design to produce vector files. A laser cut has only two axis, which is X and Y, whereas a 3D printer has 3 axis, which is X, Y and Z. A robotic arm will be working in a 3D space, so it will have 6 axis, which are respectively X,Y, Z, A, B and C. We learned about how the machine works, as it uses light amplification by a stimulated emission of radiation. During the class, we get to see a demo on how it works. Each laser cutter machine has parameters, such as: power, speed , frequency and air compressor. The higher the frequency, the more energy will be focused on the same spot. The input geometry will need to be a vector or raster file. If it is an image, we can transfer image pixel to a raster friendly version. Overall, I think it is very interesting as when I did projects for my architecture school, there are different settings compared to the current machines we have on fablab. One thing that is notable is that my architecture school has all the materials preset in the laser cutter interface, since it is quite predictable what we will be using as materials. In the fablab, since we can cut anything and almost everything, we really need to pay attention to setting the parameters and testing things out. We were able to observe the Vinyl cutter machine and see how it works. The difference here is that the Vinyl cutter is not using light beam but a physical knife to cut through the projects. We also get to see an amazing drawing drawn by the Vinyl machine. Overall, I was able to make a few models from the laser cutter machine. It was a fun experience.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term02/07-prototypingfordesign/#pictures-and-exercises_2","text":"","title":"Pictures and Exercises"},{"location":"term02/07-prototypingfordesign/#references_2","text":"I got most of my data from here: Lecture Resources .

The reason why input and output is important is because it will help us reveal the info. We also learned about automated system And a closed loop system: a system that understands what is going on around with the surrounding. An example for a non close loop system is a 3D printer. They have no input output so they could not tell if they achieve the movement or not, they will just keep going on even if there is some obstacle on the printing bed as there is no sensor on it. A sensor is a resource for the machine to infer what is happening about the environment. It does not necessarily have to be direct, for example to measure the air quality of the city, we can simply use a sound sensor. We can infer that the sound of the motor vehicle is inversely proportional to the air quality without actually needing a sensor that reads the chemical composition of the air. I also think the idea of sensor fusion is interesting where we connect multiple sensor and analyze the data. The idea of the amount of sensors our digital devices have sounds alarming, as knowing that our information is being collected at this very moment by big companies and we could not do anything about it quite yet since technology advancement could not keep up with the digital law enforcement. When going through the list of sensors, I am very interested in the pulse sensor as it makes me think of the lie detector. I found this interesting project here and here I also think the notion of using graphite as a tool creating non-traditional human interfaces is inspiring. As a Product designer, I have been doing a lot of design on screen. It would be really interesting to design an interface without needing a computer screen.

It is interesting to see how thin each layer can be to make a 3 dimensional object. There are also some interesting resources that was shared with us: Reprap website : 3D printer world\u2019s wikipedia. A netflix documentary called: Print The Legend, showing how an open source company changed to a closed one. In terms of technical knowledge, we learned that to 3D print something, it is important to be able to subdivide the object into multiple sections. There is also two types of bonding, by heat or through chemical bond. Some popular 3D printing tech are FDM, SLA, and 3DP. The route of file transfering will take from an STL file, to a Slicer, and then lastly to a 3D printer. There is a flexibility to choose how big is the layer, layer height and etc. For the infill type, there are 4 main structure: rectangular, triangular or diagrid, wiggle and honey comb. I learned that support is important when printing occurs in air, or if the light needs time etc depending on the time needed for the plastic to cool down. There are many different software that provides design optimized support calculation. It is also very important to keep moisture from material to avoid air bubble. For 3D scanning, it is important because it can help represent the real world to the virtual environment.

Ariel is incharge of electronics, while Jimena will be working on the MVP, documentation adn project planning. I will be in charge of mainly on project ideation, providing sketches, designing the physical artifact, documentation, and the Rhino File preparation. Things that I take into account is the size of each compartment for the pointers, and also what would be the ideal size for children to hold it. I designed the pointer so that there is about 4mm off set space when it is placed on the board. Furthermore, since the distance between the scale on the board need not be based on a real ruler, I separated it based on the distance between the compartments. I am also contributed to the design and crafting for the sensor box.","title":"Explain your contribution to the project"},{"location":"term02/07-prototypingfordesign/#reflect-your-learning-goals_1","text":"I think as a team one of the struggles that we had is still electronics Even though this time we spend a significant less time since we have a clearer idea of the artifact and pre planned things, it is still rather challenging working with new components. When we are doing the 3D printing for the microphone, we also struggled with the time as it takes so much longer that we expected. To solve this, we split the file into two different printers so that the total time taken would be shorter. For the CNC part, we also took an excessive time to figure out the digital files. We were required to make 2D of the file so that it is readable. Then, we had to go through the whole thing through the rhino cam so that it is readable. In the end, everything turns out alright. It looks cohesive and we are quite pleased with what we had done. Even though there are some small accidents here and there, as a team, we managed to resolve the issues.

I personally find this class very interesting as a UX designer. During work, we also understand data and use data for design. Generally there are two ways of using data: the first way is to collect data myself and I use it and the other way is that I use data collected by others. During the first day, most of the lecture focuses on how we can collect data in person. The process of forming a project generally looks like this: having set an objective, broad questions, focus on understanding, observe, analyze, reason, take decisions, and go back. We also learned about different types of data available online. The first type is Open data: something that is publicly disclosed, not restricted based on who you are, anyone can access. In terms of Shared Data, it is something that is limited, restricted, like data on your facebook account (requires log in), or company collective. While closed data , is something like a bank account. Using the Wikipedia example, it is a collection of knowledge also at some point coming from data itself, and it is one of the biggest collective efforts into generating repositories that can be generated freely. Some open data sources includes Barcelona Open Data , Free Data , London Data , and Stats OECD . I also wonder the notion of celebrating the open data because as not everyone could make use of the data and access the data. There are institutions that would have taken advantage of open data such as the government and military. Openness does not mean the same thing, not anyone can take advantage of the data the same way, it depends how the data can be used. To improve accessibility, I think that is where UIUX comes in.

During the group project, part of my responsibility is providing support in making the stand for our Curiosity Cards, and also observing people\u2019s behaviors.

Experimenting with Raspberry Pi Hands on work to capture data Group Hack MD \u00b6 Group members: Sami, Wen, Seher, Carolina, Dhirti, Jimena Hack MD During the feedback session, one of the main concerns that I hear is that our goal is blurry. There is no clear direction of what we are intending to measure. For example, even though we have already taken the amount of scans into account, we did not measure how many people are actually passing by the scan. This can be problematic as the data collected will not be as accurate. From a UX designer point of view, I do agree that there are areas that lack clarity as a whole, we did not have a clear aim, target user, constant variables to ensure the quality and type of data collected. We also need to take into consideration factors such as trust, location, type of user to get more accurate data. Nevertheless, it is still a good starting point for us as we come from a diverse background. If I were to remake this experiment, I would first form a hypothesis that I want to prove so that I can come out with a cause and action relationship when extracting data from the public.

It is an interesting introduction to systems thinking + design thinking. I also learned about different groups of people and how to get exposed to exciting student opportunities. I find the notion of system design interesting as it brings the responsibility of the successfulness of a design decision on the efficiency of the system instead of putting it on the shoulders of the stakeholders. If I were be using a few sentence to summarize what a Mushroom Model does in a design process, I would say that it is great for brain storming, risk checking, product analyzing. I am quite interested to learn more about the parameters to measure the successfulness of the mushroom model and comparing how it is applied to physical and digital product. During the next day, we learned about why do we measure impact. I learned that it is important as it allows you to understand your project better and it will serve as a good communication tool. If you know what you want to measure, it is a way of letting other people know what\u2019s important to you and create alternative presents where we can extend our projects to a bigger platform. On the third day, we started the day with an ice breaking activity. Each of us was given a paper and we will be taking turns to draw a portrait of another person. It is a great activity for us to get to know each other. Then we talk about value to find out what is important to you. We decided what value we would be using, in our case, justice, and will be figuring out justice as a framework. For the value seminar, the first things that came into my mind were commitment, kindness, resilience, responsibility and selflessness. I think commitment and responsibility is exceptionally important for everything that I do. As a group, we have chosen justice as the value to work on. We did a collage activity where we talked about justice and prepared the collage for a presentation. Overall, the distributed design seminar provides me a hollistic perspective on my ongoing work and also provide tools in designing a measurement framework for any prospective projects. I would apply what I learn from this seminar and have create a more inclusive and open project. Group Mushroom Model \u00b6 On the first day, we choose ChatGPT is our topic. As an conclusion, we find it quite hard to start a dialougue on this topic as it is quite abstract. Eventually, we were able to exchange opinions and did some research as a group so that we collect useful data to prove our points. The way we move around the mushroom is also quite interesting, we started with making > power > value > knowledge. It is slightly different comparing to the other groups, or example the fertilizer, the bread and the hairpin group. Reflection Tree \u00b6 Individual/ responses to the Reflection tree with group reflections Value Presentation \u00b6 As a group while doing the collage exercise, we talked about distribution of power, the different spectrum of justice and how do we actually measure it. Most importantly, we think justice is also something that gives a meaning to what we do. Reflections \u00b6 Documenting your process on your web including the following reflections (learning skills, dynamics, interactions) for each day\u2019s activity. Day 01 \u00b6 Learning Skils \u00b6 Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? In terms of hard skills and soft skills, I learned that I would need to know more about history of chatGPT and AI chatbot in general so that I can have a comprehensive view on the subject. I think good communication skills is really important and I am still struggling to express vague ideas to something concrete. I will use this opportunity as a playgorund for me to trial and error on my communication skills. Dynamics \u00b6 How was the dynamic inside the group? The first session, the dynamic is really great as were able to explore and raise interesting conversation regarding chatGPT. We started from making, power, then value and knowledge. Whereas when we are doing the next session, I find myself talking more as I am the one that\u2019s staying behind. I would say that we are quite open minded thus the discussion on chatGPT is rather fruitful. Interactions \u00b6 Did the role I played influence my opinion? Personally, I am a flexible person and I do not have a strong opinion on things. I am able to be unbias and rational about the opinion taht I would be sharing. As I am representing my group to speak up as a final presentation, I find myself being extra concious that I am just somebody that communicating our ideas. So in short, I do not think that my role has influenced my opinion. Day 02 \u00b6 Learning Skils \u00b6 Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? For today, I learned to be more open minded and being able to access values in a more hollistic way. Using the parameter that is prepared, we are able to collectively discuss and see where our project stands. Dynamics \u00b6 How was the dynamic inside the group? The dynamic was great as we are working in our existing group. We had a good working experience. Jimena, Ariel and I will be doing the reflection together since we have shared project. Then we had a discussion and reflect on the different areas of the project. In the end there will be a chart where we can see which value that is important to us, how can we improve the project so that it can improve. Interactions \u00b6 Did the role I played influence my opinion? No, my opinion is non bias and clear. We were able to remain rational while discussing options and possibilities of our project. During the interactions, we were trying to break open value and trying to understand what they mean. The goal of the reflection tree is to help us to evaluate a selected project so we can understand our project impact in relation to the values. I think it is quite insightful. Day 03 \u00b6 Learning Skils \u00b6 Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? For today, the skills that I have is resilience. I am open to changes and able to move forward with my idea even though there is a lot of obstacles. If I will try to talk to more people so that I can test out my ideas. I believe that having conversation with other people is a way of understanding yourself better. This is because as you express yourself, you discover parts of yourself that you never realize. Dynamics \u00b6 How was the dynamic inside the group? The dynamic was proactive as we are working together with like minded people. We are able to engage in fruitful conversation about justice and power. It is also a nice meditation session while we do our collage. Interactions \u00b6 Did the role I played influence my opinion? As a team member, I contributed my part and opinions. We are able to share our own histories and vulnerable thoughts while talking about justice. This is because we think that only those who has suffered with unfair treatment would think justice as something that is necessary. I think my personal history shaped my opinion more than the role that I have in the group did.","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term03/01-distributeddesign/#distributed-design","text":"","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term03/01-distributeddesign/#reflections","text":"In this seminar, we learned about distributed design.

In everyday life, we interact with robots more than we think we know. A normal kuka arm robot has about six axes, and the way to count it is to see how many joints that they have. With a robot, we can do almost everything. I know that for putting together electronics or things like laptops and handphones, robotic arms were used to put them together for precision. We had a basic understanding of the type of robots and the systems behind it. We saw a lot of robots use wood assembly, cutting, etc. We also see the system behind the robots. In robots, there are many kinds of joints, such as polar, cylindrical, cartesian, jointed arm, and SCARA. The different types of joints will dictate what kind of movement the robot will be doing. There are two types of coordinate: base coordinates and tool coordinates. How a robot moves also will be different depending if it is a joint or linear movement. The difference will be their orientation and velocity. The Kuka robot has no sensor so it will be quite dangerous. When you are using a robot, you need to know where the switch is. There are three states: press, and not press, and all the way. There is a way of controlling the robot with rhino - grasshopper. We spent the rest of the class to learn how to use grasshopper to install Rhino. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 As a class, there was a demonstration on how to use grasshopper for stimulation. Shortly after, we tried it out in class. Trying out scripts on my computer: Trying out together with our friends: Process Images Process Video Grasshopper Scripts Grasshopper Scripts for first test . Grasshopper Scripts for second test . Grasshopper Scripts for third test . References \u00b6 For this class, I am mainly looking at the lecture resources here. Learning Outcomes \u00b6 My personal learning outcome for this section is to have better understanding on robots and understand how to use Rhino and Grasshopper as a tool to create stimulations. Blender \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Today, we learned about Blender. We learned about why it\u2019s important to use Blender. Blender is not intended to be a CAD tool. The main reason why we use a tool is how we feel when we are using it. Freedom is more important than ability. When using a tool in any discipline, the tools shape the results in any discipline, the tools shape the results of your creation. This is because when you are not sure what you want to do, you will let the tool guide you, then it will shape your creative work. Then, there is a danger of creating homogeneous work. Before using blender, it is important to understand why the tool we are using is the way that it is. The main point is for selling licenses and monetization. Thus, the tool designed will be designed to appeal to how the majority will like it. That means that if you are the 2% chances are your needs will not be attained. In this case, there will be misalignment from the business to the user. They sell the concept of an intuitive tool. But the truth is, something that is intuitive does not require the user to put in much effort, this is why the results are similar. Nowadays, people don\u2019t like to go through too much trouble, they care more about feeling good and showing that they are amazing without really considering that what they made is exactly the same from other people. Thus, the ability to modify the tool is extremely important as a designer. We also learned about the concept of Free Software. After that, we learned about the brief history of blender and had the rest of the class learning and exploring about blender. I think what Victor shared is really valid. I appreciate understanding this before learning blender because it gave me an insight on how design tools work. Personally, I really enjoy using Figma and I do find some similarities from Figma and Blender. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 I have downloaded Blender on my computer and will try it out accordingly. References \u00b6 For this class, I am mainly looking at the lecture resources here. Learning Outcomes \u00b6 My personal learning outcome for this section is to feel more comfortable with Blender as a tool and start some projects using Blender. Week 02 \u00b6 Life Coding As a Human Interface \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 Today, we learned about human interface and explore how to use coding to create interactive interface.. We got insights about program language, device interfaces, data interfaces, wireless connection, and the other how to potentially appling it on art projects. It is interesting to see the connection between interaction, electronics and embodiment comes together with performing art and electronic art. We also saw some cool projects, and it inspire me to think about how I can potentially apply this on our final interventions. We were also introduced the concept of live coding, as it allows us to generate and think content in a non-linear format. They have also shared a video from ALGO polis 2022. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 We tried a couple settings on the Hydra website in class. References \u00b6 Hydra Hydra Resources Learning Outcomes \u00b6 My personal learning outcome is to be able to try out different ways of creating interactive interface with coding. Blender IO \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 We learned about how the concept behind blender and python and see how we can control it. Personally, I find it insightful because this allows me to have a deeper level of understanding on the capacity of Blender. Most of our class time were spent in trying out demo and understanding the concept of using Blender IO. I really appreciate this method of teaching in the seminar as we are able to follow through the lessons. I feel so guided and taken care of during the entire class time. If there is future possibilities, I hope there will be more classes like this. I sincerely enjoy my classes with Victor, as he is really patience and explain things well. He made sure everyone to be able to follow through his demo. Pictures and Exercises \u00b6 As a class, we tried to run python in class in Blender together. The command we used is add > mesh > monkey This is Suzanne the Monkey. I also learned that using bpy. we can have access to a lot of possibility. We also tried to array ten monkeys and executing it in class. After, we tried to rotate Suzanne with our phones. Since I am using an IOS devise, we need to find an application that can read the sensor. After that, we were able to do a demo on arduino as well. We were trying to control LED strips using blender and arduino. References \u00b6 For this class, I am mainly looking at the lecture resources here. Recomended software for phone here .

In everyday life, we interact with robots more than we think we know. A normal kuka arm robot has about six axes, and the way to count it is to see how many joints that they have. With a robot, we can do almost everything. I know that for putting together electronics or things like laptops and handphones, robotic arms were used to put them together for precision. We had a basic understanding of the type of robots and the systems behind it. We saw a lot of robots use wood assembly, cutting, etc. We also see the system behind the robots. In robots, there are many kinds of joints, such as polar, cylindrical, cartesian, jointed arm, and SCARA. The different types of joints will dictate what kind of movement the robot will be doing. There are two types of coordinate: base coordinates and tool coordinates. How a robot moves also will be different depending if it is a joint or linear movement. The difference will be their orientation and velocity. The Kuka robot has no sensor so it will be quite dangerous. When you are using a robot, you need to know where the switch is. There are three states: press, and not press, and all the way. There is a way of controlling the robot with rhino - grasshopper. We spent the rest of the class to learn how to use grasshopper to install Rhino.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"term03/02-prototypingfordesign/#pictures-and-exercises","text":"As a class, there was a demonstration on how to use grasshopper for stimulation.

We learned about why it\u2019s important to use Blender. Blender is not intended to be a CAD tool. The main reason why we use a tool is how we feel when we are using it. Freedom is more important than ability. When using a tool in any discipline, the tools shape the results in any discipline, the tools shape the results of your creation. This is because when you are not sure what you want to do, you will let the tool guide you, then it will shape your creative work. Then, there is a danger of creating homogeneous work. Before using blender, it is important to understand why the tool we are using is the way that it is. The main point is for selling licenses and monetization. Thus, the tool designed will be designed to appeal to how the majority will like it. That means that if you are the 2% chances are your needs will not be attained. In this case, there will be misalignment from the business to the user. They sell the concept of an intuitive tool. But the truth is, something that is intuitive does not require the user to put in much effort, this is why the results are similar.

The class started with these 3 important things about technology: Technology is part of our existence It is not neutral, not does it determine us. Design is ethics by other means We also learned about the IceBerg model. I think this really helps me in understanding better how humans behave. As a UX designer, this seminar relates to me alot. Events: what is happening? > react Patterns of behavior: what trends are there? > recognise and anticipate Underlying structures: how are the parts systematically related? > challenge and design Mental Models: what value, assumption and belief shape the system? > transform It is interesting to learn how the technological aspect in our daily life is hidden. Sometimes we forget that technology is unavoidable. We forget that the systemic nature of technology is everywhere. When we see a normal picture, for example a picture of a forest or a bathroom, we forget the technological concept of this. The important lesson is that tech has receded from our perception. This is sometimes dangerous as somebody becomes oblivious and indifference, they are not aware of the impact they might create while using technology as a tool. What I appreciate about this session is that Ariel emphasizes the importance of the value of each tool created. It also creates an awareness on why or how each culture or action is being carried out. We had an extensive conversation about guns as a tool and the values assigned behind the invention of guns. I personally find it really insightful and we had an interesting and extensive conversation about it in our class. In conclusion, this class has opened up new perspectives. Something relates to me personally is the notion of designing with the people. I always believe that in order for a product to be successful and attaining to user goals, we have to design with the party involved, instead of designing for them. It is important to have the values being throughly thought out before creating the any product. It teaches me to be more critical when viewing any designed object. An object is not just an object, it holds the value, the culture, or even the beliefs behind every design decision. Week 02 \u00b6 In today\u2019s session, we learned about the philosophical view of design. We explored what is design, and as a designer, what would be the impact that one can have based on the design decisions. I fully agree that as a designer, especially in interaction design, we should not be forcing the user to behave in a certain way. I once took a course about UX Evil by design and recognized that a lot of the UX design strategies are intentionally forcing users to behave in a certain way. Thus, I found the concept of nudging preferable as it still gives users the choice to make decisions. In this digitalized world, it is getting more and more common to have more digitized products. Almost everyone will encounter or use an application on a daily basis. However, I think users should still have the freedom to decide what they want from the application themselves, not just justified by the UX design strategy. I think the fundamental problem about this is that UX is a new field and there are no guidelines that controls what should or should not be done. Secondly, UX is something that is heavily related to business goals. Almost all UX strategy has the intention to translate design decisions into monetization tools. Thus, I think the values and virtues from this class are quite insightful for me. This is because I used to work in a real business environment, and even though my design solves user\u2019s problems, it is not necessarily contributing to the well being of the community and elevating planetary crisis. Thus as a designer, I think it is important to know that you have the responsibility and also understand what you are fighting for. With that, it is easier for us to achieve work satisfaction and find meaning in our effort. In conclusion, I think being a responsible designer is important. To me, a good design that is beneficial to the community and society requires wisdom. You will need a lot of careful thoughts, critical thinking and be morally upright to make responsible decisions, especially when that design decision is going to have a magnitude of impact. Thus, designers hold a special role in the world, as they are the ones that provide the stage which will dictate the means of people\u2019s interactions with many things at all scales.","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"term03/03-designethics/#design-ethics","text":"","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"term03/03-designethics/#reflections","text":"","title":"Reflections"},{"location":"term03/03-designethics/#week-01","text":"In today\u2019s session, I learned that nowadays when designing, it\u2019s common that we design for monetization and make people make certain choices.
