Reflect on the 4 different roles of prototyping by answering the following two questions. Which ones have you used and for what purposes? Which ones you haven\u2019t used and how do you think could be interesting for you? Afterward, select the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them, and other design activities that you want to use. My RtD toolbox will be a combination of Accumulative, Expansive, and Probing. Based on my experience, when the research direction is clear and specific, I would use Accumulative. When I have a concept with a few ways to illustrate an idea, then Expansive would be my approach. Probing is a technique that I use when I am working with ambiguity. As a UIUX designer, the most common role of prototyping that I have been using is a prototype as an Experimental Component. I prepared low-fid and high-fid prototypes to carry out usability testing or showcase to see if it works. Most of the time multiple prototypes were prepared for a scenario to see which provides a better experience. One of the examples that I did during my work: UX Case Study I had experience using prototypes as a Means of Inquiry through my previous project: Reimagining My Sejahtera This is a way for collecting data and seeing how humans interact with the design. My Sejahtera is a covid-19 tracking and appointment management app in Malaysia, my partner and I redesign the app based on a series of research and interviews. We launched the designs and sent the prototype to people around us. Then, we use the heatmap to visualize the user flow throughout the process. We learned about users\u2019 pain points and struggles through interviewing them. In the end, the final product produced is a series of interventions based on the data we collected. My experience of prototyping as a Research Archetype is when I had to make \u2018space\u2019 in architecture school through a kit of parts: wood, strings, and tapes. We end up using the materials to visualize the scale for different spatial situations and floor plans. It is helpful as we were able to bring our project to 1:1 scale, physically experience and experiment with it before putting our ideas into rendering software. Our temporal installation is also tangible, this means that we can easily change the experience with just a few touches. Besides that, I also had experience choosing materials and finishing from catalogs while I was doing architecture-related projects. I have not experienced using prototyping as a Vehicle of Enquiry. This can be an opportunity for me to apply this method in my upcoming projects. Using prototyping as a tool to document and analyze the process sounds interesting to me. I have never tried this method, so I might apply this on my future design product. It would be interesting to see how I can craft a digital or physical product through this method of prototyping, as normally I am inclined to use prototyping as a test of hypothesis or an open ended exploration due to my job nature. I also think this way of prototyping is very liberal, as the results will not be limited by a preconceived notion or a specific group of people. Since I have quite some experiences with the different roles of prototyping, I would like to start with using prototyping as a Vehicle of Enquiry, the one that I experienced the least so that I can equip myself with this skill set. It seems to me that Probing might be a good pairing with this role of prototyping. With this in mind, I will set this pair as a general direction when executing my upcoming design project. At the same time, I will keep an open mind to include other RtD tools and roles of prototyping whenever it is necessary should the scenario change. My Work Space \u00b6 Create a \u201cnew workspace\u201d where your present and desired RtD toolbox can be used. You need to map what you have available for your project (materials, infrastructure, things, and people) either here or in other places. For this part of the assignment, I will be focusing on networking, resources and people that I have as I think they are the most crucial part to complete my future design intervention. Communication Strategies \u00b6 Choose 1 or more roles and formats from the list that was collectively created in class and put them into practice. Write a post with a reflection on the communication strategy that you are devising for the next stages of your project. The communication strategies that I have chosen are: Compiling the experiences you have already had to aid you when pitching or explaining your process to others can help you move forward. Show your work or a specific topic from your own point of view. Simple language for accessibility. Being transparent about your intentions, offering a space where people you are trying to reach and connect can understand better your background, your values, your commitment, your motives, and your positionality \u2013 creating a foundation for trust. Creating demos, demonstrators, or experiential prototypes. Experiment with new formats, such as WhatsApp, videotaping etc Photographing Video journaling Zoom gatherings With that in mind, I created a series of pitch presentations to communicate my ideas. I have compiled things that I learned in a simple and legible format using infographics. This will help readers to get a sense of the direction of the project. I am also inspired to create a tutorial video for my crisis/hope box. This is something that I have never tried before. It will be a great starting point as there is a potential of reaching a wider audience not limited by location and time differences. Besides, I would also like to experiment with using hashtags to create a supportive community. I plan to execute my ideas in 4 different stages, and I am interested to use in-person meetings, zoom gatherings, WhatsApp and google meet to carry out the workshop. Intervention \u00b6 For my intervention, I would like to learn about The willingness for people to embrace the opportunity to heal Is this model useful to encourage people to learn more about their family? Will the participant learn something new about themselves through activity? Will participants are open to participating in something like this in future? From 24 th - 27 th of November, I was able to gather responses from 16 people through a guided activity and questionnaire using this google form . I have used the Double Diamond Design Model as a framework, first exploring all the possibilities, then deciding which part I would like to focus on based on the data and feedback collected for any prospective design intervention. This intervention is divided into 4 parts. First, I created a short questionnaire as preparation and data gathering. I have included this image to see if there is a relationship between people acting on the different hemispheres of the brain and the willingness to heal. (Thanks to Antonio for sharing this!) Then, I prepared a short activity for the participants to trace their family tree and family history. After that, they will be describing their parents, loved ones and close friends. Last but not least, I have included some feedback questions to see how they feel after the whole activity. I have been doing this through three ways, the process takes approximately 20-30 minutes Zoom/ Google meet Whatsapp In person Tools Google Forms, Device Pen and Paper Methodology This methodology has been excerpt partly from It didn\u2019t start with you by Mark Wolynn I have prepared the survey in 3 languages to accommodate my targeted users. Demographics People that have participated in this activity is from Malaysia, Indonesia, Spain, Korea, United States and Canada. I have reached out to family, friends, colleagues, and strangers that I have been talking to in a language learning app. Their occupations are not limited to students, working professionals, athletes, and instructors. While carrying out this activity in person, as some part of the activity is quite personal, I tried to look away when the participant is drawing their family tree and writing a description of their parents. Key findings Half of my participants do not suffer with mental health issues, and half of them think they might be suffering or are having mental health issues. Most of them are quite close to their family members, their results ranging from the scale of 7-9. When they are asked if they can name any major negative events that happened to their parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, there is a significant increase in the number of \u2018No\u2019 as they move further up the family tree. Most of the participants started to lose track of the historical events that might have happened. The question \u2018how well do you think you know your family history\u2019 is repeated twice on my survey to find out how the activity that is carried out will impact the participants\u2019 thoughts. We can see this in comparison as the same question is asked before and after the activity. There is a reduction in number for people who voted for scale 7-9 after doing the exercise. We can deduce that after doing the exercise, participants realize that they might not know their family history as well as they think they do. After the exercise, there is quite some positive response that most participants have the intention, or at least not refusing to learn more about their family history. After the activity, we can see that more than half of the participants cannot find something in common that they might share with their ancestors. This is interesting to see as about half of my participants voted that they do not suffer with any mental health issues. I wonder if these two data might be related. Nevertheless, it is great to see that at least close to half of the votes shows that the participants start to realize the relationship between their family history and themselves. For the part of writing a description of their parents and loved ones, based on the data that I have collected, about half of my participants felt surprised after the activity. Thus they might have discovered something that they do not know about themselves previously. There are some people that feels uncomfortable, thus this might be something to take note of in the future sessions. Is this feeling of discomfort beneficial for the activity or should we aim for reducing the discomfort? Most of my participants learned something new about themselves after carrying out this activity. Most of my participants are interested to find out more information about their family history after this exercise. Atleast about half of the participants might have experience some change in how the perceive themselves after this activity. Last but not least, there is no negative feedback for the desire to participate in an activity like this in future. Based on the activity, it is evident that Not all people is open to talk about their family Some space and privacy might be needed should a bigger group of workshops be conducted, or perhaps it is better if we have a private group eg: a group of friends that know each other and are comfortable in sharing these. Conclusion Overall, this is an interesting experience for me as it is uncomfortable, especially for me to ask strangers that I have just been talking to for a few days to participate in this activity. It also took me some time to design this as in the beginning, I planned to collect the deliverables (their family tree and their descriptions of their loved ones). However, I find that maybe it is too personal for me to have access to all the information. Thus, I switched it up and used a google form instead so that the participants can participate without disclosing their family history. I prefer to do this activity with someone that I know well. However, I extended out of my comfort zone as most of my participants are randomly selected. This also helps me to put things into perspective, and ensure the compatibility of this activity for a group of strangers. For future prospective intervention, I would still be interested in finding subtle ways to intervene with the healing process. I hope that it would be a small move, but leaves a big impact to the participants. I also hope that in my future prototype or design, I can provide options to the participants to take charge in designing their own healing and restorative process.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term01/00-designstudio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term01/00-designstudio/#research-and-prototyping","text":"Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on \u201cyour poster, your vision, and desired professional identity\u201d.

Upload your first post, name it \u201cBootcamp\u201d. It should contain: What\u2019s your fight? Upload the poster you shared in class, explain it in a few paragraphs. B. Vision, collaboration plan and personal development Create your own personal development plan for the master (1 st Trimester). Create your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge, and attitude. Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge, and attitude Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). Justify and describe your personal development plan for the master program. Part A \u00b6 Something that I have always felt strongly about is issues related to mental health. Emotional pain from trauma or depression can be detrimental, yet it is not always being taken seriously. It\u2019s important to recognize that early mental health symptoms are pointing towards a more serious illness. Many people ignore their symptoms as they are afraid to be stigmatized. Most of the time, we\u2019re waiting for something terrible to happen, such as suicide, overdose, violent outburst, or heart attack before we take things seriously and do anything. This picture shows what depression might look like for those who have never experienced it. Things that seem mundane to normal people can be very difficult for those who are suffering with mental illness. People with depression might find it difficult to see things as it is, for example: the sky, without being swallowed by their own thoughts, assumptions and thinking patterns. Mental illness is common, but care is lacking. The window serves as a reminder that things can get better. There is always hope no matter how bad the situation is. One day, people will heal from depression, and they can just look at the sky and see the sky as it is. There will be a day when they can just look back at their sufferings, and smile because they get through it. The battle against mental illness is a long fight, and it requires the right kind of treatment and the proactivity of the patient in order to heal effectively. I hope that mental health treatment and services will be more accessible and affordable. I think when we are talking about helping others and contributing to society, it is important to draw attention internally to ourselves first. This is because when you\u2019re whole and healthy, then only you will have the capacity to help others and take care of the well-being of the surroundings. Part B \u00b6 While my fight are issues related to mental health, I am also passionate about resource management and circular economy. With this in mind, I made this development plan for this trimester. I speculated some major issues that I might encounter through this process. I hope to contribute by designing a product that aids the circular economy. Thus, I am interested in systematic design for effective resource management in each city. In the near future, most consumers will be consuming local produce and materials, and be able to recycle waste effectively. During the meetings with \u00c7a\u011fsun, Ahmed, Myrto, Seher and Stella, it was encouraging to learn that everybody comes from a diverse background with several years of professional experiences, some of them share similar visions as I do. One of them have encouraged me to continue developing my projects on mental health related issues since it meant so much to me. I suffered with trauma, depression, anxiety and personality disorder, thus I worried that I lost myself and get too personal in the process. While I am not entirely certain that my project will be related to mental health issues, I will be incorporating some mental health goals for myself for this part of the assignment. I am a UIUX designer with an Architecture background. I was a teacher in an international school. Furthermore, I am also an illustrator that is planning on publishing children books, and a co-founder for a small home bakery start-up in Malaysia. These are the core skills and knowledge that I have professionally. Through this masters program, my prospective future plan is to build up my skill set and portfolio catering more towards a UX designer/researcher direction while getting a holistic view to the emergent future industries. Generally, based on my experience, I am confident that as long as I put my mind into something, I would be able to achieve it. What pulls me back from success and happiness are the words that I tell myself subconsciously and thoughts in my head.

Emotional pain from trauma or depression can be detrimental, yet it is not always being taken seriously. It\u2019s important to recognize that early mental health symptoms are pointing towards a more serious illness. Many people ignore their symptoms as they are afraid to be stigmatized. Most of the time, we\u2019re waiting for something terrible to happen, such as suicide, overdose, violent outburst, or heart attack before we take things seriously and do anything. This picture shows what depression might look like for those who have never experienced it. Things that seem mundane to normal people can be very difficult for those who are suffering with mental illness. People with depression might find it difficult to see things as it is, for example: the sky, without being swallowed by their own thoughts, assumptions and thinking patterns. Mental illness is common, but care is lacking. The window serves as a reminder that things can get better. There is always hope no matter how bad the situation is. One day, people will heal from depression, and they can just look at the sky and see the sky as it is. There will be a day when they can just look back at their sufferings, and smile because they get through it. The battle against mental illness is a long fight, and it requires the right kind of treatment and the proactivity of the patient in order to heal effectively. I hope that mental health treatment and services will be more accessible and affordable. I think when we are talking about helping others and contributing to society, it is important to draw attention internally to ourselves first. This is because when you\u2019re whole and healthy, then only you will have the capacity to help others and take care of the well-being of the surroundings.","title":"Part A"},{"location":"term01/01-bootcamp/#part-b","text":"While my fight are issues related to mental health, I am also passionate about resource management and circular economy. With this in mind, I made this development plan for this trimester. I speculated some major issues that I might encounter through this process. I hope to contribute by designing a product that aids the circular economy. Thus, I am interested in systematic design for effective resource management in each city. In the near future, most consumers will be consuming local produce and materials, and be able to recycle waste effectively. During the meetings with \u00c7a\u011fsun, Ahmed, Myrto, Seher and Stella, it was encouraging to learn that everybody comes from a diverse background with several years of professional experiences, some of them share similar visions as I do. One of them have encouraged me to continue developing my projects on mental health related issues since it meant so much to me. I suffered with trauma, depression, anxiety and personality disorder, thus I worried that I lost myself and get too personal in the process. While I am not entirely certain that my project will be related to mental health issues, I will be incorporating some mental health goals for myself for this part of the assignment. I am a UIUX designer with an Architecture background. I was a teacher in an international school. Furthermore, I am also an illustrator that is planning on publishing children books, and a co-founder for a small home bakery start-up in Malaysia. These are the core skills and knowledge that I have professionally. Through this masters program, my prospective future plan is to build up my skill set and portfolio catering more towards a UX designer/researcher direction while getting a holistic view to the emergent future industries. Generally, based on my experience, I am confident that as long as I put my mind into something, I would be able to achieve it. What pulls me back from success and happiness are the words that I tell myself subconsciously and thoughts in my head. Thus, for the future desired attitude, I will be focusing on spiritual enlightenment, finding inner peace, and self acceptance. I have included a personal goals section. These are collective things that I do that made me genuinely happy. These are also something that will help me to recharge and be a source of creativity when I am feeling down.

Text: A brief 500 Words (1 doc page) explaining the areas of interest you framed in the Design Space.This can be done with the following guidelines: I. What are your main weak signals, and why did you choose them? Are they related to your fight? Do they represent areas of research you always wanted to explore but have never had the chance to? Are they related to your previous background and experience? How do you think they are relevant right now locally and globally? These are the kind of questions you can explore here. II. What areas of opportunity do you think they can offer? My Design Space \u00b6 Weak Signals in The City \u00b6 I have always been interested in issues related to mental health ever since having personally experienced chronic depression and anxiety. It was a really painful process and I wish that nobody will ever have to experience it. This is because when you are trapped in your own heart and mind, there is no place for you to escape, it is like a living hell. It is absurd that while there is so much air, you still get out of breath, spending hours and hours laying awake. I guess that\u2019s the reason why some individuals might choose to end things and give up on their lives. My grandfather\u2019s generation suffered from poverty and my father was able to change the fate of his entire family with seven other siblings through higher education. Therefore, from a young age, I grew up believing that education is the key to escape poverty, and the thought of \u2018I have to be a professional to survive and make a living\u2019 was planted inside my head. Therefore, I went to architecture school and tried my best to get all the required skill sets in order to get a job as a professional. As I switched my career path and became an UIUX designer, I noticed that I would still develop side projects related to mental health. I write and illustrate short stories that are heartwarming for adults, posting them on instagram, and have been running a website for two years. Although my drive for issues related to mental health is always there, somehow I could not find a connection and opportunity for me to connect it with my career. I tried to make a living with this passion, but it did not work out for me. It seems like the only way to do it is to be a counselor or therapist. This results that even though I am doing very well as a UIUX designer in my previous company, I am always looking forward to the time outside of my work to do things that I like. Since I am spending 40 hours (or more) per week working, I felt very lost and numb during working hours. Some might argue that being able to have existential crises is a luxury, because we have all our human\u2019s basic needs to survive, such as food, shelter and safety. Yet, we still suffer, just on a different spectrum. I think it is an opportunity for all of us to question ourselves, raising our consciousness to another level to attain a greater level of peace and happiness. When I started with the bootcamp poster assignment, subconsciously I still believed that my drive towards mental health is \u2018useless\u2019. I felt anxious when I was the only person shouting that drive out loud. At that moment, I was not able to picture myself pursuing a project related to it. Thus naturally, when crafting my personal development plan, I draw my attention to another issue that interests me: recycling and resource management. Also, recycling and resource management feels assuring to myself as there is a vision and direction for me to develop the project. When I could not find anything related to mental health in the physical card deck, there was a small reassuring voice in my head saying that it is right to just focus on recycling and resource management, and forget about issues related to mental health. It is more relevant to the future, and all the pressing crises that we are experiencing as a global citizen. Afterall, mental health related issues are too personal and delicate, and it is hard to see the profoundness of it in relation to the climate crisis. In terms of scale of impact, the climate crisis concerns the survival of the entire earth\u2019s citizens, yet mental health seems like a personal issue to me as not everyone suffers drastically from it. Things started to change after a conversation that I had with Mariana. As she suggested, I looked at the Miro board with the new digital card decks that were added. I noticed that most of the new cards that I have chosen have more connection to mental health and spiritual awakeness. My gut feeling is telling me that I should just follow my heart. Afterall, climate change and mental health are connected. There are studies that show mental health impact on climate change. It was an epiphany moment for me, as I realized that when there is a climate crisis or pandemic, mental health support will be equally important. While people die from drought, tsunami, covid-19, earthquakes, heatwave and so on; but remember this, people die from depression too. So I went on and develop my design space with a few area of opportunities in mind with my main weak signal, Climate Conscience. My area of opportunities includes Ideation and Design Centric research, Design for Social Innovation, AI and Machine Learning and Maker Education. I am looking for a way to make mental health support more accessible and effective for those who are in need, specifically on prevention and recovery. This will open up more research directions such as what causes depression, healing transgenerational trauma, the role of the subconscious mind in depression etc. The first idea that I have is the notion of a \u2018Crisis Box\u2019. The \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 concept arises from one of my therapy sessions. Individuals that are suicidal are advised to create a crisis plan. This normally consists of a pen and a paper, some questionnaire, and the process involves jotting things down, writing emergency contacts and preventive plans. Personally I find this process tiring and dreadful, especially for somebody who failed to see the purpose of living. I divided the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 concept for different stages. In the early stage, I will source recyclable materials and try to prototype a \u2018Crisis Box\u2019. I would need to do some research on what goes into the crisis box. At this stage, the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 will be catered for depressed and suicidal individuals. Then, if this version of the prototype works, I can create a laser-cut friendly template so that this can be scalable and has the potential of becoming a community maker\u2019s project. For this stage, I will start exploring the potential of \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 for non-depressed individuals as a preventive measure. This will also open up another possibility of preparing a \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 as a gift for someone you love. Afterall, everyone has ups and downs in their life. It would be nice that there is a prevention plan or things to do when we are grieving. As a community, we are not taught to handle grief and sadness properly, that might be the reason why some would resort to alcohol, substance abuse and other activities that are a health detriment. If this version works, I am hoping to collaborate with local therapists to utilize this \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 in the therapy session to see if this prototype can be useful in practice. In the event of a climate crisis, I wonder if there is an opportunity to make the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 a handy kit that can accommodate different mental health needs. I would also like to explore possibilities to use AI and Machine Learning, incorporating the \u2018Crisis Box\u2019 idea into a digital product. I hope to study the role of AI in detecting depression, and coming out with a customizable preventive or recovery plan for future iterations. The second idea that I have is using art and illustration in healing depression. Pictures and art are a form of non verbal communication, there are studies that indicate picture books can improve mental health. It is a way for using pictures to communicate directly to our subconscious mind. One way of doing this is using picture books and children\u2019s stories as a means to illustrate values and concepts in therapy sessions. I am very interested to see if it would make it easier for the patients to take in concepts and values. I am still developing my ideas on this, as this is a side project that I have been working on for years. I tried to contact some publishers in the past, however the most frequent answer that I get is that most picture books are for children, there is no market for adult picture books. In spite of that, I will be visiting the Frankfurt Buchmesse 2022 this coming weekend. I still have no idea what I might do, but I will be meeting an experienced Malaysian illustrator that has published many children\u2019s books, and I can use the booth if I want to when I am there. Perhaps talking to her would help to develop my thought processes. Aside from that, another way of using art and illustration in healing depression that I can think of is through creating art therapy or expressive therapy workshops with the community. When people gather together and carry out activities, it will be an opportunity for them to establish ties, creating a safe space for emotional assurance. With my UIUX background, I hope to relate or create a digital product, so that it can benefit people that suffer with mental health issues on a larger scale. As a designer, I hope that I can contribute my knowledge and skill sets working with psychiatrists and counselors so that the therapy process can be accessible and effective, healing and preventing depression can be easier than it has ever been before.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term01/02-atlasofweaksignals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"term01/02-atlasofweaksignals/#instructions","text":"Design Space and Weak Signal Design Space: High-resolution screenshot or multiple screenshots of your Design Space if it\u2019s too large.

Transdiagnostic Psychological Interventions: Why Do It Any Other Way? The article spoke to me as I had experience in being diagnosed with a personality disorder and the process feels unreal to me. I remember back then I filled in an 8 question quiz in less than 10 minutes after talking to the psychiatrist. After seeing the results, I was labeled \u2018mild\u2019 with that particular personality disorder. Then there are certain treatments methods including medications and plans which sounds a lot like normal advice that anyone would give to those who are in pain.

Will that thought necessarily help in recovering? Will the results come out differently if I am in a good mood on that day? What are the standards to decide if a symptom is \u2018chronic\u2019? My experience is not something new among the people who has personality disorder, as through this research article , we can see that: \u201c\u2026the findings adds to the ongoing concern about the stigma, prejudice and poor provision of services for people with personality disorder. It states that consumers with personality disorder often do not receive an explanation of their diagnosis, or experience stigmatizing language and insufficient evidence-based information about their diagnosis.\u201d With that note, I agree that a transdiagnostic approach might be much more plausible rather than classifying patients into different categories of disorder. This will be a holistic approach, and removing biases and potential errors during diagnosis. According to this article , it supports the above statement: \u201coverwhelming weight of evidence from decades of such data-driven efforts indicates that mental health problems are best conceptualized along a series of continua rather than as discrete categories.\u201d Furthermore, according to Lisa Ekselius\u2019s research on Personality disorder: a disease in disguise, the other common problem with the classification system is that persons with personality disorders are known to be under-treated with respect to physical health and are over-represented in the group categorized as the \u2018difficult patient\u2019. There are initiative to make a shift focusing on the commonalities between different personality disorders, according to this article : \u201cThere is a clinical shift from an earlier focus on the characteristics of discrete personality disorder entities to an awareness of the common features of different personality disorder, the suffering of patients, and the many problems they face in interpersonal relationships and daily life.\u201d However, wIth all the positive points mentioned, there might still be some controversials on the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic approach for certain illnesses such as PTSD. According to this article : \u201cThere is no published empirical data comparing a transdiagnostic approach to single-diagnosis protocols for PTSD\u2026trials are needed to understand the effectiveness of transdiagnostic models as well as the comparative effectiveness of transdiagnostic and symptom-focused treatment.\u201d While it is undeniable that there are key challenges that we might encounter while adopting this practice, however, it would still be an improvement from the current classifying system. From all the data that I collected, I therefore conclude that the points where the original article mentioned that transdiagnostic models might be a pleasurable alternative are accurate.","title":"Bio & Agri Zero"},{"location":"term01/03-bioagrizero/#bio-agri-zero","text":"","title":"Bio &amp; Agri Zero"},{"location":"term01/03-bioagrizero/#instructions","text":"I.

According to this article , it supports the above statement: \u201coverwhelming weight of evidence from decades of such data-driven efforts indicates that mental health problems are best conceptualized along a series of continua rather than as discrete categories.\u201d Furthermore, according to Lisa Ekselius\u2019s research on Personality disorder: a disease in disguise, the other common problem with the classification system is that persons with personality disorders are known to be under-treated with respect to physical health and are over-represented in the group categorized as the \u2018difficult patient\u2019. There are initiative to make a shift focusing on the commonalities between different personality disorders, according to this article : \u201cThere is a clinical shift from an earlier focus on the characteristics of discrete personality disorder entities to an awareness of the common features of different personality disorder, the suffering of patients, and the many problems they face in interpersonal relationships and daily life.\u201d However, wIth all the positive points mentioned, there might still be some controversials on the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic approach for certain illnesses such as PTSD. According to this article : \u201cThere is no published empirical data comparing a transdiagnostic approach to single-diagnosis protocols for PTSD\u2026trials are needed to understand the effectiveness of transdiagnostic models as well as the comparative effectiveness of transdiagnostic and symptom-focused treatment.\u201d While it is undeniable that there are key challenges that we might encounter while adopting this practice, however, it would still be an improvement from the current classifying system. From all the data that I collected, I therefore conclude that the points where the original article mentioned that transdiagnostic models might be a pleasurable alternative are accurate.","title":"Article"},{"location":"term01/04-livingwithyourownideas/","text":"Living With Your Own Ideas \u00b6 Instructions \u00b6 I.

With this observation, I might rework the process if I were to redesign this grief coping method. For example, I will have the user that tracks their emotions to first list out whom their loved ones are prior recording their feelings. Also, while carrying out the experiment, I wonder instead of diverting attention to somebody else that you love, is it alright to recognize the fact that the person who caused you pain is actually the same person that can also bring you joy?

Conflict and Relations Mapping \u00b6 I created a map with potential ideas. Collectively as a group (Sami, Ramiro, Cagsun, Antonio and I) we are interested in mental health, neuroscience, human interaction with tech and data, human habits and commodities. I am curious on how these points might potentially converge. The map shows all the areas of interest in context relating to the potential touchpoint with local communities. Mapping the Local Ecosystem \u00b6 For this part of the course, we were engaged in a role play to imagine how we can engage in community practice in the shoes of the stakeholders. As a group, it is an interesting experience as it helps to shift focus and perceive the project in other\u2019s perspective. This method would help me to negotiate and communicate with the stakeholders better, since then we can foresee what might be the point of interest for the related parties. Group Work Card Deck \u00b6 This was the card that I have chosen from the group work card deck. I would like to remind myself to apply this method in my upcoming design projects. I have chosen the card \u2018Seeing the Forest, Seeing the Tree\u2019 as it reminds me to perceive the bigger picture in any situation. Also, this shows that the any data collected can be used in many ways, and to know how to use it (whether to look at the summary of the data or individual choices) requires wisdom and experience. This also reminds me of a chinese quote: \u201c\u5f53\u522b\u4eba\u770b\u89c1\u6811\u6728\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u8981\u770b\u89c1\u6574\u7247\u68ee\u6797\uff1b\u5f53\u522b\u4eba\u770b\u89c1\u5149\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f60\u8981\u770b\u89c1\u4e00\u9897\u661f\u661f\u201d. It means that when somebody saw a tree, you have to be able to see the whole forest; when somebody sees a light, you have to know that it is a star. On a wider perspective, I am reminded to take a step back when accessing a situation because sometimes the closer you look, the less you see. Only when you are distancing yourself without involving personal emotions, then you are able to perceive the situation with reason without judgement. Group Work Card Deck Info Social Presencing Theory Workshop \u00b6 During this workshop, we learned that sometimes we forget that we can retrieve a lot of information from our body and non verbal communication. In fact, our actions are actually part of our subconscious mind. As a class, we have embodied assemblages of both human and non-human actants for sensing underlying dynamics and locating opportunities for action. We use \u201chigher educational system\u201d as a general framework and intentionality. It is interesting to see our 4D model as a cohort as each person might make a different choice. For my case, I was representing \u201cgovernment\u201d in the system. Therefore, I might project my personal experience while representing the actant. Both models, before and after, seem like an accurate representation of what the current higher education system is and what the \u2018ideal\u2019 education system looks like. The model that represents the current system has a sense of hierarchy in it, and the \u2018student\u2019 in the system is at the bottom of the hierarchy. In contrast, in the new \u2018ideal\u2019 system, the \u2018student\u2019 , depicting a warrior pose, holds an active role in deciding the higher education system. Envisioning My Intervention \u00b6 In general, I am interested in creating or finding a community that is interested in mental health issues and shows willingness to heal. Potential participants: - Friends and Family - Yoga Community in Malaysia - Seattle\u2019s Community - MDEF Colleagues - Language Exchange community Context There\u2019s an ancient Hindu story about the gods arguing over where they should keep the secret of happiness. Afraid that humans didn\u2019t deserve or couldn\u2019t handle this secret, they debated where to hide it. At first they considered putting it at the top of a high, high mountain, but reasoned that humans would eventually be able to find it. Likewise, they might find it in the darkest forests or at the bottom of the ocean. Finally, an idea struck one of the gods: \u201cI know the perfect place. We will hide the secret of happiness in the deepest depths of their own hearts. They will never bother to look there.\u201d Most people did not know that we all have the ability to heal ourselves within us. While mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are getting common day by day, there is still not enough knowledge and tool kit available and accessible to the public. Current Situation Mental health is a very delicate topic, thus I am exploring ways to be not intrusive, gentle, at the same time allow the user or participants to have the option to turn back or protect themselves should they decided that it is not a safe area. The question is, how can we help people to reach this level of consciousness and bring them into the realization that they have the choice to heal without being intrusive and respecting their boundaries? Engagement and Limits I am exploring ways to engage participants on a deep level, yet there is still a restriction on creating a \u2018safe space\u2019 for them to be open for exploration, especially when it involves strangers. As mental health subjects can get very personal, I wonder where I should stop, and how I should approach the participants without being intrusive. Theory of Change If participants can realize that they hold the power to understand themselves better, and all that they have to do is to take the first step and being curious about their own history, perhaps in some way, they will discover part of them that was hidden. This is also a good opportunity for the participants to take some time for themselves. Design Challenges and Opportunities One of the biggest challenges is to reach out to strangers. I had a small community of people that I have been talking to on a language app. We are united in the desire to learn and be proficient in a new language, therefore through daily conversation and practices, we are able to establish trust, enough for them to agree and participate in this activity.
